 ukraine.1.t:0 "A Nation on the Brink"
 ukraine.1.d:0 "The streets of Kyiv are quieter than they once were. The cafés where poets once debated the future of Ukraine now host only hushed conversations, as wary eyes glance over shoulders for informants. The air is thick with resentment, a bitterness that has festered since the Holodomor stole the lives of millions. In the countryside, farmers hoard what little grain they can, unwilling to feed a system that abandoned them to famine. The once-proud Sich Riflemen, sidelined and humiliated, whisper of betrayal.\n\nVasyl von Habsburg sits in his gilded palace, a king in name but a prisoner in practice. His word carries no weight without Berlin’s blessing, and the German settlers—planted across the land like weeds—tighten their grip on the countryside. Ukrainian aristocrats and bureaucrats, once willing collaborators, now find themselves outnumbered in their own government as German administrators oversee every aspect of the state. Germany ensures that the Grand Duchy remains the breadbasket of the Reich, draining its fields to keep Germany fed, while its people grow ever more bitter and restless.\n\nEverywhere, resentment simmers beneath the surface. The veterans of the Sich Riflemen, cast aside by a state that no longer needs them, find themselves aimless, their loyalty fraying with each passing year. Nationalist agitators, though hunted by the secret police, speak of the Grand Duke as a traitor, a Habsburg puppet ruling at the whim of Berlin. In the villages, priests whisper of divine retribution, while in the cities, factory workers seethe under German overseers. The army, bloated with German officers and plagued by internal divisions, is less a force of defense and more an enforcer of occupation.\n\nThe Grand Duchy stands like a house of cards, fragile and swaying. How much longer can this last?"

 ukraine.2.t:0 "The Boy and the Empty Field"
 ukraine.2.d:0 "The land was dead. The great fields of golden wheat that once danced in the wind had long been harvested, not by the hands of the people who lived there, but by the German landlords who now owned it. What little remained was locked away in grain silos, guarded by men who spoke a foreign tongue. The village had once been full of laughter—his mother’s voice, his father’s stories, the warmth of the hearth. Now, there was only silence, and the boy hated it.\n\nHe knelt by the roadside, staring at the vast emptiness where his home had stood before the famine took everything. His mother had begged the landlords for just a handful of grain, enough to keep them alive, but they laughed in her face. Days later, she was gone, her body left in a shallow grave dug by trembling hands. The boy remembered the hunger, the gnawing pain in his belly, the way his father stopped speaking, his eyes dull and empty. He had left one night and never returned. The boy didn’t ask where he went. He already knew.\n\nThe Germans had taken their land. Vasyl von Habsburg had let them. The boy had never seen the Grand Duke, but he knew his name, spat out in curses by those who had survived. He had heard the whispers in the village, the muttered prayers that God would strike down the foreign king and his masters in Berlin. But God had been silent, just like Vasyl had been when his people starved. Just like Vasyl would be when the next famine came.\n\nA carriage passed by on the road, its occupants draped in fine Austrian silks, their German guards riding alongside. The boy’s fists clenched. The people in the village said that one day, Ukraine would be free—that the Habsburgs and their German lords would pay for what they had done. The boy did not know if that was true, but he knew one thing: when that day came, he would be there."
 ukraine.2.a:0 "One day, the Grand Duke will suffer as we have."
 ukraine.3.t:0 "The Weight of Guilt"
 ukraine.3.d:0 "The soft creak of the door roused Vasyl from his sleep. His servants entered in practiced silence, setting down his breakfast on the polished oak table beside him. He barely stirred as they moved about, their whispers low and careful. This was routine—another morning in his golden cage.\n\nWith a weary sigh, he sat up and glanced at his meal. Bread. Freshly made, warm, fragrant. Ukrainian grain, kneaded into perfection by the hands of his cooks. His fingers traced the crust absentmindedly, but his mind was already elsewhere.\n\nHe saw the streets outside the palace gates—hollowed faces, sunken eyes, hands trembling from hunger. He had walked among them once, disguised in a simple coat, watching as they begged for crumbs while German guards patrolled with full bellies. He had seen mothers clutch their lifeless children, their bodies wasted away to nothing, as the grain silos stood full, their contents bound for Berlin. And he had done nothing.\n\nHis chest tightened as another memory surfaced—1920, the coup. The day he had been chosen to rule. Pavlo Skoropadskyi, once the Hetman of Ukraine, dismissed like an unruly servant. The Germans had needed a puppet, someone with royal blood but without real power. He had accepted, thinking he could save Ukraine from the shadows. But all he had become was a figurehead, an ornament atop a nation ruled by foreign landlords and bureaucrats.\n\nHis grip on the bread tightened. The simple loaf in his hands felt heavier than gold. It was stolen, just like everything else. A gift of luxury built on the bones of his starving people. His stomach churned. He could not eat this. He would not.\n\nWith a sudden motion, he tossed the bread onto the floor. His dog perked up, eagerly devouring the meal his master refused. Vasyl exhaled slowly, pressing his fingers to his temple. The guilt was unbearable, but there was no time to dwell. He had meetings to attend, papers to sign, and decrees to rubber-stamp.\n\nHe stood, allowing the servants to dress him in regal finery. Only a few minutes had passed since he awoke, but it felt as though he had relived years. The past clung to him like a shadow, one he could never escape. But escape was never an option. He took a deep breath, straightened his posture, and stepped toward the door.\n\nIt was time to play his part."

UKR_Another_Day_in_Mariinsky_Palace:0 "Another Day in Mariinsky Palace"
UKR_Another_Day_in_Mariinsky_Palace_desc:0 "The mornings begin the same. A quiet knock, the shuffle of servants, the scent of fresh bread—Ukrainian grain, stolen from Ukrainian hands. Vasyl von Habsburg does not eat. He dresses in the finery of a ruler who rules nothing and steps into the halls of Mariinsky Palace, where another day of empty routine awaits. His schedule is dictated before he wakes: meetings with German administrators who speak of quotas and exports as if he were not there, audiences with Ukrainian officials whose loyalty is as thin as the paper their grievances are written on. Reports from the countryside—whispers of unrest, starvation, and discontent—pass through his hands before being discarded. The Reich expects him to smile, nod, and sign. And he does.\n\nHe walks the same gilded corridors he has walked for sixteen years, drowning in ceremony and false authority. Letters arrive, begging for relief from those who still believe he has the power to give it. He reads them, then watches as they are tossed aside. The Grand Duchy is a house of cards, and Vasyl is its prisoner, bound to his hollow duties by chains of silk and gold. Evening falls, and he returns to his chambers. He stares at his untouched meal, his stomach empty, his guilt unbearable. When he does eat, he cannot keep it down—his body rejecting the stolen grain as violently as his conscience does. And as he closes his eyes, he wonders—not for the first time—if tomorrow will be any different. He already knows the answer."

UKR_royal_duties_desc:0 "Every day in Mariinsky Palace is the same. Vasyl von Habsburg wakes to the scent of freshly baked bread, a cruel reminder of the grain stolen from his starving subjects. He dresses, adorned in royal finery, and begins a schedule dictated by Berlin. Meetings with German administrators blur into empty discussions of quotas and exports, while Ukrainian officials bring grievances he has no power to address. His signature is required, his presence expected, but his words mean nothing.\n\nHe walks the palace halls in silence, a prisoner within his own court. Letters arrive, filled with desperate pleas for aid, but they are discarded before he can act. The day drags on, filled with formalities and false smiles, until he retreats to his chambers. His evening meal waits for him, untouched, the weight of guilt pressing harder than hunger. When he does eat, he soon forces it back up, as if purging the shame along with the stolen grain. Then, he sleeps—only to wake and begin it all again.\n\nVasyl is "

#Characters
 UKR_vasyl_von_habsburg:0 "Vasyl I"
 UKR_vasyl_von_habsburg_desc: "Vasyl von Habsburg, born Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen in 1897, was thrust onto the throne of the Grand Duchy of Ukraine in 1918 after a German-Austrian coup toppled the nascent Ukrainian state. A fervent admirer of Ukrainian culture, Vasyl initially sought to present himself as a champion of the nation, adopting Ukrainian customs and promoting cultural revival. However, his power was an illusion, dictated by Berlin, which saw Ukraine as little more than a grain silo for the Reich.\n\nFor over a decade, Vasyl walked a tightrope between pleasing his German overlords and maintaining the trust of the Ukrainian people. This precarious balance shattered in 1932 when a devastating famine, orchestrated by Germany to extract Ukraine’s grain surplus amid an economic crisis, ravaged the countryside. Millions perished, and Vasyl’s inaction, born of his dependence on Berlin, forever tarnished his image.\n\nOnce a hopeful symbol of unity, Vasyl became a bitterly despised figure, a collaborator in the eyes of his suffering subjects. The famine, remembered as the Holodomor, saw Ukrainian nationalist leaders like Yevhen Konovalets brand Vasyl a traitorous puppet of foreign powers. Stripped of legitimacy and influence, his court in Kyiv descended into irrelevance, and his throne became a hollow monument to German hegemony. By the mid-1930s, whispers of rebellion and assassination surrounded him, as both Ukrainians and Germans sought to replace their discredited proxy. Vasyl’s reign, marked by compromise and capitulation, left a legacy of failure—an enduring cautionary tale of a ruler trapped between imperial ambition and the cries of a dying nation.""

 UKR_german_chain:0 "The German Chain"
 UKR_german_chain_desc:0 "Ukraine’s fate is not its own to decide. Every law, every economic policy, and every military decision is dictated by the Reich. The Grand Duchy exists only as long as it serves German interests, and should Vasyl von Habsburg step out of line, he would be replaced in an instant. To cement their grip, Berlin has settled thousands of German veterans across the land, granting them estates carved from Ukrainian soil. A new aristocracy of German officers and administrators slowly but steadily tightens its hold, pushing native elites aside as the Grand Duke watches helplessly. After the war, Germany saw Pavlo Skoropadskyi as a danger to their goals of making Ukraine their client state and the breadbasket of Germany, serving only German interests, which could not be achieved under his leadership. This led to a German-sponsored coup in 1919, replacing him with Vasyl von Habsburg. Germany remembers the hunger of the Depression and knows Ukraine’s vast grain fields, the breadbasket of the Reich, are key to preventing such a catastrophe from happening again. For the Reich, losing Ukraine is unthinkable—and it will stop at nothing to keep its grip, no matter the cost."
 UKR_unstable_country:0 "The House of Cards"
 UKR_unstable_country_desc:0 "The Holodomor did not just starve Ukraine—it shattered its fragile foundations. Once hailed as the liberators of the nation, the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen, the backbone of the Grand Ducal Army, have been cast aside, their loyalty eroded by memories of German grain theft and Habsburg betrayal. Anti-German and anti-Habsburg sentiment festers in the streets, whispered in darkened taverns and muttered in the fields. Vasyl von Habsburg stands upon a crumbling throne, ruling a land that loathes him. Any misstep, any sign of weakness, and the Grand Duchy will fall like a house of cards."

The fields have long since yielded their crops again, but the scars of hunger remain—both in memory and in reality. Ukrainian farmers hoard their grain in defiance of the state, industry struggles to recover from years of devastation, and trust in the Grand Duchy is all but nonexistent. Even now, the people remember who took their bread and who let them starve."

ukranian_autocracy:0 ""Absolute" Monarchy"
ukranian_autocracy_desc:0 "While an absolute monarchy in name, the sovereign is but a relic of a bygone era, a hollow figurehead draped in the trappings of authority yet utterly powerless. The real levers of power lie elsewhere, controlled by those who truly shape the destiny of the state. The throne remains, but it is little more than an ornament, a gilded cage for a ruler who does not rule."
