 Soviet.14.t:0 "In the Moscow"
 Soviet.14.d:0 "After Kamenev's death, Russia is in turmoil. Stalin, Zinoviev, and Trotsky are pursuing their own interests only and have no interest in the people.

 Soviet.15.a:0 "What will happen to Russia."
 Soviet.16.t:0 "Handsel"
 Soviet.16.d:0 "'The solution to the problem at hand comes down to one thing: The Kremlin needs to make a decision. The Red Army needs to expand, and it needs a mobilization order under the chief secretary. The institute wants a positive response.'\nMikhail Tukhachevsky sighed. Western countries call their countries the Eastern countries. It means that they are still not civilized, and that they cannot recognize a communist state. Brest-Litovsk made the reality even more equate with this perception. Russia is dreaming of revenge. Gen. Tukhachevsky does not dismiss the goals of his subordinate party as delusional. Until the day comes when he topples Prussia again, the Red Army will remain in a quasi-war situation. The Party continued to expand. Then, limits came. The Constitution exists in the Federation. It is the role of limiting the manpower that the military can draft, the factories that can mobilize. A few days ago, the military reached its limit, and the institute recommended that they write an proclamation. Mikhail is well aware of the reality of the military. Should we put more people in pain with our own hands? Should we listen to those who missed their chance? At least for Mikhail, that is not to say that the period is double digits, although the war is still a long way off. The Kremlin places responsibility on its owners. The responsibility is a two-sided day, so it embraces authority and pain at the same time. Within minutes, the chief secretary signed a brief order. Expand conscription and mobilization, force more people to serve the country. Those who took the order did not see his face. Distortion, or jubilation, would never know. Mikhail himself would never know."
 Soviet.16.a:0 "Sacrifice for the Cause."
 Soviet.17.t:0 "Risking Punishment"
 Soviet.17.d:0 "Kremlin, Moscow. There is a man working in the same place as the hometown of the Bolshevik Revolution. Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin held Russia's everything. Party reactionaries who showered and condescending are shivering in the cold in prison in Siberia. Red Napoleon's brilliant dream turned sour and leaned on the leadership of his country. Bukharin became the chairman of the People's Committee. As if no one could confront him, he was troubled. This is because the problems that came up at the last Politburo meeting were still unresolved. Maybe it cannot be solved. The goal of the working government is always one thing: to tear apart the German bourgeoisie. The ideal of washing away the humiliation that took place in 1918 had never been weakened. Nikolai remembers everything vividly. From Leningrad to entering the Moscow court, he spent every hour of oppression on the people. He will never forget it. But will the experience ever be courageous? In Nikolai's hand was a document. The Red Army Research Institute and the Politburo seemed to ask for it. The current Red Army is too weak to drive Germany out, so you have to make a decision - sign an extra mobilization letter. His anguish went deep. But who would drive the people into a limb? Koba, if you're his friend, you don't know, but you weren't yourself. The conditions in the military are terrible, you know, and you're going to get a lot more people suffering and you're going to swear at him. Nikolai was afraid to make a choice, which was... too cruel. But it had a point. And the Kremlin was forcing him to make a choice."
 Soviet.17.a:0 "-Signed: Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars."
 Soviet.18.t:0 "Get on Board"
 Soviet.18.d:0 "Conquest of the regime. No one would think that this road would be easy. But it would be because there is a great desire to try it. And Tukhachevsky has that grand goal.\n-toppling the bourgeois empire, including Germany, and enveloping the world in a wave of communism -\nBut today's Bukharin regime is blinded only to taking revenge on Germany. His policies will eventually result in the payment of Soviet Russia to the great enemies of France and Britain and the United States. He has been planning a coup to prevent this, and now he is trying to gather his comrades along this cause, from simply not wanting to follow Buharin to those who have different goals... Right now, it doesn't matter what their purpose is. We just need more comrades to make the coup successful."
 Soviet.18.a:0 "Acting the same way but with different objectives in mind."
 Soviet.19.t:0 "Only as a military under a civil government"
 Soviet.19.d:0 "If the tsar who ruled all of Russia were to look at his last days, he would exhale heavily. Although we don't know what the ill-fated dark lord's view of the state was, Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin is certain. The reality of not being able to control the Red Army is devastating. Today, the once-glorious army is little more than a cabal at the whim of a handful of generals. It is degenerating, disintegrating. If only this order could put all your worries to rest! The Politburo is about to execute the plan it has been preparing for the past few days. It's a declaration to everyone in maroon uniform. Nikolai wants the prestige of the damned old men to be fatally damaged. The military is to fulfill the following directives There will be a Soviet-appointed political officer in every unit above a certain size; his advice must be heeded by all. Nikolai has already made a list of party members to be sent to each unit. They are all trustworthy - at least they don't follow Tukhachevsky - and competent. He's done his best to make it impossible for the likes of the Red Napoleons to kick them out on the grounds of incompetence. If the Red Army were totally against the measure, we'd be in trouble, but the old guys would shrug it off as no big deal. Maybe they wouldn't even notice it, hidden among the hundreds of documents that came in every day. Either way, Nikolai's plan would succeed. He signed the order nervously, then summoned his chief of staff and told him sternly: 'This must never be made known to him. The only general who had protested vehemently was Tukhachevsky, that cunning viper. The mainstay of the army had re-enacted the order, unaware of its significance. The Politburo meeting held that day was filled with applause from the jubilant crowd. The Soviet Communist Party now had even more control over the Red Army: it could monitor their every move. Nikolai poured a long drink to the members of the committee, showing his satisfaction."
 Soviet.19.a:0 "We'll have to find St. Helena of Russia."
 Soviet.20.t:0 "Cut off limbs"
 Soviet.20.d:0 "“What is this, no, no, I can't go on like this! No!” Bukharin took power, and for a time, tensions ran high throughout the Soviet. After an unseen war of words between Bukharin and Tukhachevsky, Bukharin vowed to cut off Tukhachevsky's limbs. Rokossovsky was imprisoned, and Yakir quickly asked Bukharin for a voluntary demotion, ending in self-criticism. Since Bukharin took power, fear has been spreading among those who followed the old troika and those who now follow Tuchachevsky. The Troika has completely collapsed, so any repression will be a non-issue for Bukharin, but if he fails to effectively crush the Tuchachevsky faction, he may face a coup."
 Soviet.20.a:0 "Unstable Soviet"
 Soviet.21.t:0 "Purge on Officers"
 Soviet.21.d:0 "Finally, the Masu of the purge reached into the interior of the Soviet army. Last night, several senior military officials were suddenly taken away by political police, who are said to be under investigation for treason. This means that the military is no longer safe from purging."
 Soviet.21.a:0 "It's terrifying"
 Soviet.22.t:0 "Trial for Bukharin"
 Soviet.22.d:0 "The final trial of Buharin and the traitor was held today. They were arrested a week ago on charges of treason and all of them were finally convicted. Buharin was exiled to Siberia, and the rest were sentenced to severe punishment. And hereby Stalin is actually able to take control of the [SOV.GetName], and it's likely that a major clean-up of the remnants of the clique that threatened Stalin will begin."
 Soviet.22.a:0 ""And it came to the end.""
 Soviet.23.t:0 "Bukharin took a Power"
 Soviet.23.d:0 "Stalin's purge threat made the anti-Stalin factions in the [SOV.GetName] feel a great sense of crisis, which in turn led to them fighting against Stalin.

 Soviet.25.t:0 "The Soviet Civilwar"

Recently, Stalin began purging his political opponents, which greatly stimulated Stalin's opponents in the [SOV.GetName], such as Bukharin.

 Soviet.29.a:0 "That's a good sign."
 Soviet.31.t:0 "Request for Cooperation of Bukharin"
 Soviet.31.d:0 "Yesterday evening Buharin approached our government in secret, calling for increased support against Stalin. Since Stalin came to power, our government has continued to support Buharin and has thrown the [SOV.GetName] into chaos. But in recent years, Stalin has begun to rapidly expand his power, and Buharin seems to feel threatened. Our decision is..."

After looking around for a while, he began to walk toward the bartender. The\n"Ilyich Ulyanov"\nbartender listened to his meaningful words and glanced at him, before moving his steps somewhere. Without saying a word, the man began to walk along the leading bartender. The bartender stopped at a door and slipped aside, as if to go in there. When the man opened the door, the attention of the people in the room was instantly focused.\nIt's an atmosphere that doesn't seem normal at all.

Bukharin's face was red as if he were very angry.\n"Obviously, you said that if I cooperate with you, you would put me in charge of the People's Commissar. But look, you put me in a low position!"\n"Comrade, I said I could, but I never said I would." Buharin trembled with anger at Trotsky's pun.\n"You had it coming."

In a country once inferior and oppressed to anyone before 1917, workers are enthusiastic about the birth of a federation waving their flags."
 Soviet.61.a:0 "Be glorified, our free Motherland"
 Soviet.62.t:0 "Soviet Civilwar Break Out"
 Soviet.62.d:0 "Russia faces another civil war after a deepening conflict between the Troika faction, which supports the New Economic Policy, and the Soviet opposition, which opposes it.\n\nBukharin and many others who oppose the tyranny of the Troika have started an uprising, and the outcome of this civil war is likely to change the fate of the Soviet Union significantly."
 Soviet.62.a:0 "Who will win."
 Soviet.63.t:0 "Another Revolution"
 Soviet.63.d:0 "In the middle of the speech hall, a red flag stood tall. Carved with a gold hammer and a sickle, the flag was a symbol that promised prosperity, development, and revolution for the workers. However, Yuri knew that it was a cloth stained with ash and blood. Every time the flag waved, his eyes were reminded of the faces of the countless enemies he had killed.\n\n"Comrades," shouted the young political commissioner at the podium, his voice filling the room. "Today, we have taken the first steps to heal the divisions of the past, to establish a new supreme Soviet. The world's counter-revolutionaries have said that our revolution is over, but they are wrong. The revolution is not over, it has only begun!"\n\nAll the people in the speech hall applauded, but Yuri bowed his head. The applause sounded to him like a flame burning and breaking. 'Is revolution a never-ending fight?' he asked himself."
 Soviet.63.a:0 "How much else would it take to sacrifice under this red star?"
 Soviet.64.t:0 "The New Constitution"
 Soviet.64.d:0 "The Kremlin's cellar, where the new constitution was being drafted, was filled with stifling heat. The commissioners gradually took on the shape of the constitution with hammers, as if it were a historical blacksmith. However, shouting and fistfights could be heard in a conference room full of ironclad issues.\n\n"We must not forget that we are building a new foundation for this country!" A member of the committee shouted in excitement. His hand was scrambling on the paper spread on the desk. However, the sentences left at each point where the tip of the pen passed could not be continued. To the other committee members, these were simple sentences that could collapse at any time, like a tilted tower.\n\n"Isn't that too much? I think the radical clause up to this point is going to be a problem for the future." Another pointed his finger at the desk. The "revolution" is over, but the language of the law remains unsettled and confusing. The young commissioner, red-faced and shouting "Capitalist Fracci," lunges at the desk. The provisions of the new constitution creaked and couldn't mesh like different cogs."
 Soviet.64.a:0 "What the hell kind of this is."
 Soviet.65.t:0 "Recovery"
 Soviet.65.d:0 ""Comrades! That's great news! Let's say our comrades on the front line have won!" When Ivan heard this, I couldn't remember what he had done. But I did remember the crowd cheering him on. In fact, he was a civil war, a revolution, and didn't know much about it. Isn't it the same to use the right time, whether they're both "Soviet"? But Ivan has known since his empire that, at least for now, taking sides with his defenders is how to live life without problems.\n\nFortunately, this government did meet Ivan's expectations. When the civil war ended, the government came up with a number of difficult measures that Ivan did not understand and stabilized the people's livelihoods that had been destroyed during the civil war. Of course, some people complained that it had only changed from a dilute porridge to a dilute borsch, but Ivan did not. Don't you remember the days of the Empire and the Red and White Civil War? Ivan wanted to give high marks to this government, which has at least made efforts for stability. He doesn't starve, eats three meals a day, gives him a house to avoid rain, travels around saying that it's for us, and if he can't do this, he's not a country."
 Soviet.65.a:0 "In any case, Ivan felt secure in his life."
 Soviet.66.t:0 "Under the Red Sky"
 Soviet.66.d:0 "He looked up at the sky. His entire life up to this point seemed to be beating him up like a midday rain. He resolved to always work for the people, and after shedding a lot of blood, he rose to the position.\n\n"Lenin, what should we do?"\n\nBukharin murmured quietly as he swept his head with his hand. Even though he had risen to the position of Supreme Leader. The revolution did not seem to stop yet.\n\nAbove all, he had the greatest enemy. Kaiserich in the west. The Germanic tribes that defeated both Britain and France, and overthrew even the founding Russia, which seemed immortalized. Those who humiliated us greatly with Brest Litovsk. It was obvious that they would invade the Soviet people first in the future. To prevent that, we must be strong. If you make the Soviet Union strong and preemptively strike Germany, you will have a chance of winning. Buharin's ideas were becoming more and more like the political opponents he hated without even realizing it.\n\nHe looked at the map. Germany oppressed the people of Ukraine, the Baltic, Belarus, and the vast land. Buharin shouted back to himself."
 Soviet.66.a:0 "Such a thing will never be repeated again."
 Soviet.67.t:0 "One Federation, Two Governments"
 Soviet.67.d:0 "The Soviet Union, which represents the people of all Russia, is divided. It is natural that efforts toward an unfinished socialist paradise are divided in many directions. Unfortunately, today's crisis is a rather unhealthy kind. \n\nPoor socialism is backward socialism. - The New Economic Policy (NEP), harshly criticized by Nikolai Buharin, is finally getting worse. The Red Army supports it nominally, but in fact, it is clear that what they really want is not economic policy. People who have visited Moscow at least once will see factional strife on every street they walk by. This is happening both at the administrative headquarters and at the military academies. In the situation the wounds of civil war couldn't close yet, society was divided into two.\n\nOur great Soviet Union is not united. The federal government and the military are at loggerheads and separate factional wars are going on. No one wants to succeed Kamenev, who is bent out of trying to hold hands with everyone in the world. Amid the conflict between Bukharin and Tukhachevsky, maybe the time for choice is coming."
 Soviet.67.a:0 "There can't be two stars in Russia."
 Soviet.68.t:0 "Communist Demonstrations"
 Soviet.68.d:0 "In recent years, anti-government protests calling for communism have increased dramatically. The government sees it as an operation by outside forces, and the leading candidate is Soviet Russia. They seem to incite our workers to induce various actions that undermine our national capacity. The government's response to them seems very important."
 Soviet.68.a:0 "Crack them down hard."
 Soviet.68.b:0 "Conciliate them."
 Soviet.68.c:0 "Leave it alone."
 Soviet.69.t:0 "Stalin and His Flock"
 Soviet.69.d:0 "At around 9 a.m. today, the trial began against Stalin and his flock, who are accused of state treason and of being revisionists against Marxism. A Moscow court sentenced them to a heavy sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison, while Stalin sentenced them to 30 years in prison. The historic moment came when the center of power that once held and shook the Soviet Union collapsed.\n\nContrary to what many had expected, Stalin was not sentenced to death, which may indicate that Buharin was quite conciliatory. Regardless, the Soviets are once again facing a new turning point. And the subsequent trial of Trotsky is also getting a lot of attention."
 Soviet.69.a:0 "It's the right punishment for traitors."
 Soviet.70.t:0 "Zinoviev and His Flock"
 Soviet.70.d:0 "The trial began around 1 p.m. today against Zinoviev, who faces charges of state treason and violations of anti-state thought prohibition laws, and the group that follows him. A Moscow court, like the last time, sentenced him to 10 to 20 years in prison, and sentenced him to deportation.\n\nPeople's prediction that the sentence would be similar to the previous Stalin's trial was right. No one was sentenced to death in this trial, which shows that Bukharin's governance is quite paternalistic. This has greatly reduced the fear of a large-scale political purge in society."
 Soviet.70.a:0 "We have punished the traitors."
 Soviet.71.t:0 "To an Unfamiliar Foreign Land"
 Soviet.71.d:0 "Mikhail Tutschevsky stood against the stern railing. The enemy aircraft flying in the wind on board was of the same kind as those caught in the old Kremlin spire, but seemed to him to be as shabby as ever. Why- indeed, no wonder. Just as everything in Western Russia had disappeared from Brest, Mikhail had lost all his influence. The current foe was just the end of a middle-aged man in a nice uniform. There was no strength in his body.\n\nIf you look back at the last 20 or so hours, it's just full of failures. The majority of the troops refused to accept my commanders' arguments, rather they were prone to gunfire. The plans for coup in Moscow and Leningrad have long since been exposed. The most reliable deputy was a subordinate to Buharin. Could he be worse than himself today? The core of rebellion is speed. Literally, Mikhail is the quickest general in Russia to fall.\n\nHe couldn't decide what to do. He just left the port in Leningrad with his passport and a little bit of rubles. His mother, who warmly surrounds our planet, gave no answer to him. Stars are overlapping today.\n\n'There is no shadow of the white seabirds. Even in the mast,'"
 Soviet.71.a:0 "'Even in the sea around there.'"
 Soviet.72.t:0 "Military Coup"
 Soviet.72.d:0 "Early this morning, rebels led by Tukhachevsky headed to the Kremlin in Moscow. Tukhachevsky's rebels tried to cross the barricades at the Kremlin, and government forces tried to forcefully deter them. The winner of this tight battle is..."
 Soviet.72.a:0 "His plan had been leaked and he failed to take over."
 Soviet.72.b:0 "He occupied the Kremlin."
 Soviet.73.t:0 "Political Purge"
 Soviet.73.d:0 "From this morning to this evening, hearings were held against numerous politicians involved in the Bolshevik. The trials against them were summary proceedings and proceeded very quickly. Almost all of the figures were sentenced to prison, and only a few were acquitted or found not guilty. The aftermath of this purge is expected to last quite a while."
 Soviet.73.a:0 "I'm afraid."
 Soviet.74.t:0 "Enactment of Parliamentary Act"
 Soviet.74.d:0 "Yesterday afternoon, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet enacted parliamentary act. It calls for the dissolution of all parties except one party illegal. The Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Tukhachevsky, called it a "special step" to unite the divided Soviet Union, and the bill is expected to completely solidify Tukhachevsky's one-man dictatorship."
 Soviet.74.a:0 "The Beginning of a Dictatorship."
 Soviet.75.t:0 "Search Operation Begins"
 Soviet.75.d:0 "A large-scale search operation has begun for Bukharin. He has been missing since Tukhachevsky took over the Kremlin Palace, and Tukhachevsky has organized a large force to capture him, one of the people's closest hits."
 Soviet.75.a:0 "Will the search succeed"
 Soviet.76.t:0 "Make a Successful Search"
 Soviet.76.d:0 "The search operation was successful. Bukharin was found cold in a corner of the Kremlin, where he was apparently shot dead during the coup. Prosecutors made no special charges against Bukharin, who had already died, along with prison sentences for members of his clique charged with treason."
 Soviet.76.a:0 "Finally Found Him."
 Soviet.77.t:0 "Didn't Make a Successful Search"
 Soviet.77.d:0 "Eventually, the search party could not find Bukharin. Without Bukharin, a trial was held against his flock in Moscow, and Bukharin and his flock were sentenced to death or imprisonment. Bukharin was sentenced to death but was not actually executed because he could not be found."
 Soviet.77.a:0 "Trial about Bukharin without Bukharin..."
 Soviet.78.t:0 "Execute Kollontai"
 Soviet.78.d:0 "This morning, there was the execution of Kollontai, who was sentenced to death for treason. He was one of the key figures in the Bukharin government and one of the leading 'traitors' from Tukhachevsky. His execution demonstrated to the public the establishment of a world of Tukhachevsky."
 Soviet.78.a:0 "Goodbye."
 Soviet.79.t:0 "Troika Punishment"
 Soviet.79.d:0 "This morning, a formal trial was held against the Troikas. Stalin, Trotsky and Zinoviev were sentenced to death, while other Trojans were sentenced to decades in prison. It illustrated the fall of the Bolshevik Central Powers in the past."
 Soviet.79.a:0 "Power disappears in a day."
 Soviet.80.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective]-Sponsored Rallies in the Capital"
 Soviet.80.d:0 "A number of political groups have announced rallies in the capital this week. They don't seem to have any specific grievances they want to air, beyond a general sense that we should try to improve our relations with [FROM.GetNameDef], and remove any politicians critical of the [FROM.GetAdjective] administration from any positions of power.\n\nWhile it is possible that these demonstrations are just spontaneous manifestations of the popular opinion, it is at least remarkable that a number of key organizers travelled to [FROM.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] recently, and seemed to have begun agitating for this upon their return."

 Soviet.82.t:0 "France agreed to our request"

 Soviet.84.t:0 "Coup in Moscow"
 Soviet.84.d:0 "Foreign media in Moscow reported on the shootout at dawn. Martial law was imposed in the Western Russian military districts and party forces were established in two of Russia's most iconic cities. General Mikhail Nikolajevich Tutschevsky was seen entering the Kremlin, and international politics pointed to him as a political upheaval.\n\nThe 'most revolutionary general in all Russia' was considered the heavyweight of the Red Army. Arguments are being made over whether his coup d'etat was accidental or long-prepared. But the majority agree: Soviet civil control failed.\n\nThe German ambassador to Moscow had no comment on today's situation. Many are paying attention to whether the Berlin-Moscow relationship will be affected."
 Soviet.84.a:0 "Finally, it happened."
 Soviet.85.t:0 "Night of Disbelief"
 Soviet.85.d:0 "On a dark night in Moscow, a man was looking at the night sky at the Kremlin Palace. The man, Bukharin, thought deeply about something, as if he were deep in thought. Tukhachevsky, Bukharin had that name in his mind again and again already.\nHe said he would win the civil war and build a country for workers, but recently the Red Army's Tukhachevsky was unhappy with his policies.\n\n'Something bad is happening'\n\nHe thought.\nNo, even if nothing happens, he must be a dangerous man. It may be a predetermined fate to remove Tukhachevsky from his position."
 Soviet.85.a:0 "Getting rid of him has become a necessity."
 Soviet.86.t:0 "Have an axe to grind"
 Soviet.86.d:0 "Soviet Russian army general Tukhachevsky was deeply troubled under the nightfall of Moscow.\nThe present government, the Bukharin government, is only trying to do something dangerous to join hands with our enemies France and Britain, out of vengeance against Germany. He clenched his fists as if he had decided. \n\n"He have to be taken down."\n\nIf you leave him alone, eventually the Soviets will be overthrown by capitalist-controlled states, he thought that the only way to save Russia was to bring him down as quickly and as quickly as possible."
 Soviet.86.a:0 "For Motherland."
 Soviet.87.t:0 "From the Intelligence Agency"
 Soviet.87.d:0 "Just a few minutes ago, the Intelligence Agency received shocking news: Tukhachevsky and his cronies may be preparing for a coup. In response, the Intelligence Agency has obtained some evidence. Nevertheless, while there is no conclusive evidence or evidence yet, their misconduct is sufficient to suspect it and will require further investigation into Tukhachevsky. If their coup plot is certain, they will have to come up with measures to counteract it."
 Soviet.87.a:0 "I knew it."
 Soviet.88.t:0 "Plan a Strategy"
 Soviet.88.d:0 "Successful coups require a thorough operation. We must develop an operational plan so that our army can quickly seize the supreme soviet, paralyze the functioning of the parliament, and simultaneously attack and capture the Kremlin. And we must be able to capture the supreme council and Bukharin, remove them from power, and quickly establish our government."
 Soviet.88.a:0 "Let's get it started."
 Soviet.89.t:0 "Death of Kamenev!"
 Soviet.89.d:0 "By this time, no idealist predicted that Kamenev would survive, but no one thought the day would come so soon either. His efforts to stabilize the Soviet Union by uniting the various factions within it fell to a single assassin's bullet.\n\nKamenev then held on until the New Year of '36, as if he had something to say, before dying five days later today. The entire Soviet Union is in mourning, and Kamenev's funeral was held with state honors. A troika collective leadership system was established to try to stabilize the chaos caused by Kamenev's death, and while some workers' opposition opposed it, their voices were drowned out by their relative minority."

With this, the Zinoviev faction has been completely ousted by the Troika and now only trial and punishment remain for them."

 soviet_rework_troika.027.d:0 "Yesterday evening, less than a dozen days after Stalin's entourage was thrown out of parliament, police burst into Stalin's home in Moscow and arrested him. As with Zinoviev, Stalin was arrested for treason against the state, accused of colluding with the Zinovievites, who were labeled traitors in the past. Stalin has vehemently denied this, but it's already clear what answers the government wants, and even if he doesn't give them, it's pretty clear what the sentence will be."

They are not at all compatible with Soviet ideals and should be removed from the army in advance, so that there will be no regrets later."
