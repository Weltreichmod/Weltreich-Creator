 Soviet.14.t:0 "In Moscow"
 Soviet.14.d:0 "After Kamenev's death, Russia is in turmoil. Stalin, Zinoviev, and Trotsky are pursuing their own interests only and have no interest in the people. Bukharin was angry at the Troika's behavior and had meetings with many opposition workers in Moscow.

 Soviet.15.t:0 "Workers' Opposition Criticized Troika"
 Soviet.15.d:0 "Today, an official statement of condemnation was issued against the troika of the workers' opposition in Moscow.

This incident is expected to intensify the political confrontation between the troika and the workers' opposition."
 Soviet.15.a:0 "What will happen to Russia."
 Soviet.16.t:0 "Handsel"
 Soviet.16.d:0 "'The solution to the problem at hand comes down to one thing: The Kremlin needs to make a decision. The Red Army needs to expand, and it needs a mobilization order under the chief secretary. The institute wants a positive response.'\n\nMikhail Tukhachevsky sighed. Western countries call their countries the Eastern countries. It means that they are still not civilized, and that they cannot recognize a communist state. Brest-Litovsk made the reality even more equate with this perception. Russia is dreaming of revenge. Gen. Tukhachevsky does not dismiss the goals of his subordinate party as delusional. Until the day comes when he topples Prussia again, the Red Army will remain in a quasi-war situation. The Party continued to expand. Then, limits came. The Constitution exists in the Federation. It is the role of limiting the manpower that the military can draft, the factories that can mobilize. A few days ago, the military reached its limit, and the institute recommended that they write an proclamation. Mikhail is well aware of the reality of the military. Should we put more people in pain with our own hands? Should we listen to those who missed their chance? At least for Mikhail, that is not to say that the period is double digits, although the war is still a long way off.\n\nThe Kremlin places responsibility on its owners. The responsibility is a two-sided day, so it embraces authority and pain at the same time. Within minutes, the chief secretary signed a brief order. Expand conscription and mobilization, force more people to serve the country. Those who took the order did not see his face. Distortion, or jubilation, would never know. Mikhail himself would never know."
 Soviet.16.a:0 "Sacrifice for the Cause."
 Soviet.17.t:0 "Risking Punishment"
 Soviet.17.d:0 "Kremlin, Moscow. There is a man working in the same place as the hometown of the Bolshevik Revolution. Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin held Russia's everything. Party reactionaries who showered and condescending are shivering in the cold in prison in Siberia. Red Napoleon's brilliant dream turned sour and leaned on the leadership of his country. Bukharin became the chairman of the People's Committee. As if no one could confront him, he was troubled. This is because the problems that came up at the last Politburo meeting were still unresolved. Maybe it cannot be solved. The goal of the working government is always one thing: to tear apart the German bourgeoisie. The ideal of washing away the humiliation that took place in 1918 had never been weakened. Nikolai remembers everything vividly. From Leningrad to entering the Moscow court, he spent every hour of oppression on the people. He will never forget it. But will the experience ever be courageous? In Nikolai's hand was a document. The Red Army Research Institute and the Politburo seemed to ask for it. The current Red Army is too weak to drive Germany out, so you have to make a decision - sign an extra mobilization letter. His anguish went deep. But who would drive the people into a limb? Koba, if you're his friend, you don't know, but you weren't yourself. The conditions in the military are terrible, you know, and you're going to get a lot more people suffering and you're going to swear at him. Nikolai was afraid to make a choice, which was... too cruel. But it had a point. And the Kremlin was forcing him to make a choice."
 Soviet.17.a:0 "-Signed: Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars."
 Soviet.18.t:0 "Get on Board"
 Soviet.18.d:0 "Conquest of the regime. No one would think that this road would be easy. But it would be because there is a great desire to try it. And Tukhachevsky has that grand goal.\n-toppling the bourgeois empire, including Germany, and enveloping the world in a wave of communism -\nBut today's Bukharin regime is blinded only to taking revenge on Germany. His policies will eventually result in the payment of Soviet Russia to the great enemies of France and Britain and the United States. He has been planning a coup to prevent this, and now he is trying to gather his comrades along this cause, from simply not wanting to follow Buharin to those who have different goals... Right now, it doesn't matter what their purpose is. We just need more comrades to make the coup successful."
 Soviet.18.a:0 "Acting the same way but with different objectives in mind."
 Soviet.19.t:0 "Only as a military under a civil government"
 Soviet.19.d:0 "If the tsar who ruled all of Russia were to look at his last days, he would exhale heavily. Although we don't know what the ill-fated dark lord's view of the state was, Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin is certain. The reality of not being able to control the Red Army is devastating. Today, the once-glorious army is little more than a cabal at the whim of a handful of generals. It is degenerating, disintegrating. If only this order could put all your worries to rest! The Politburo is about to execute the plan it has been preparing for the past few days. It's a declaration to everyone in maroon uniform. Nikolai wants the prestige of the damned old men to be fatally damaged. The military is to fulfill the following directives There will be a Soviet-appointed political officer in every unit above a certain size; his advice must be heeded by all. Nikolai has already made a list of party members to be sent to each unit. They are all trustworthy - at least they don't follow Tukhachevsky - and competent. He's done his best to make it impossible for the likes of the Red Napoleons to kick them out on the grounds of incompetence. If the Red Army were totally against the measure, we'd be in trouble, but the old guys would shrug it off as no big deal. Maybe they wouldn't even notice it, hidden among the hundreds of documents that came in every day. Either way, Nikolai's plan would succeed. He signed the order nervously, then summoned his chief of staff and told him sternly: 'This must never be made known to him. The only general who had protested vehemently was Tukhachevsky, that cunning viper. The mainstay of the army had re-enacted the order, unaware of its significance. The Politburo meeting held that day was filled with applause from the jubilant crowd. The Soviet Communist Party now had even more control over the Red Army: it could monitor their every move. Nikolai poured a long drink to the members of the committee, showing his satisfaction."
 Soviet.19.a:0 "We'll have to find St. Helena of Russia."
 Soviet.20.t:0 "Cut off limbs"
 Soviet.20.d:0 "“What is this, no, no, I can't go on like this! No!” Bukharin took power, and for a time, tensions ran high throughout the Soviet. After an unseen war of words between Bukharin and Tukhachevsky, Bukharin vowed to cut off Tukhachevsky's limbs. Rokossovsky was imprisoned, and Yakir quickly asked Bukharin for a voluntary demotion, ending in self-criticism. Since Bukharin took power, fear has been spreading among those who followed the old troika and those who now follow Tukhachevsky. The Troika has completely collapsed, so any repression will be a non-issue for Bukharin, but if he fails to effectively crush the Tukhachevsky faction, he may face a coup."
 Soviet.20.a:0 "Unstable Soviet"
 Soviet.21.t:0 "Purge on Officers"
 Soviet.21.d:0 "Finally, the Masu of the purge reached into the interior of the Soviet army. Last night, several senior military officials were suddenly taken away by political police, who are said to be under investigation for treason. This means that the military is no longer safe from purging."
 Soviet.21.a:0 "It's terrifying"
 Soviet.22.t:0 "Trial for Bukharin"
 Soviet.22.d:0 "The final trial of Buharin and the traitor was held today. They were arrested a week ago on charges of treason and all of them were finally convicted. Buharin was exiled to Siberia, and the rest were sentenced to severe punishment. And hereby Stalin is actually able to take control of the [SOV.GetName], and it's likely that a major clean-up of the remnants of the clique that threatened Stalin will begin."
 Soviet.22.a:0 ""And it came to the end.""
 Soviet.23.t:0 "Bukharin took a Power"
 Soviet.23.d:0 "Stalin's purge threat made the anti-Stalin factions in the [SOV.GetName] feel a great sense of crisis, which in turn led to them fighting against Stalin. Nikolai Bukharin took full control of Moscow with the group leading him, and succeeded in bringing Stalin out of power. Now Stalin is missing, and now the [SOV.GetName] is a world of Bukharin."

 Soviet.25.t:0 "The Soviet Civilwar"
 Soviet.25.d:0 "The constant threat of purge eventually led to the [SOV.GetName] entering a civil war. Recently, Stalin began purging his political opponents, which greatly stimulated Stalin's opponents in the [SOV.GetName], such as Bukharin.

 Soviet.29.a:0 "That's a good sign."
 Soviet.31.t:0 "Request for Cooperation of Bukharin"
 Soviet.31.d:0 "Yesterday evening Buharin approached our government in secret, calling for increased support against Stalin. Since Stalin came to power, our government has continued to support Buharin and has thrown the [SOV.GetName] into chaos. But in recent years, Stalin has begun to rapidly expand his power, and Buharin seems to feel threatened. Our decision is..."

After looking around for a while, he began to walk toward the bartender. The\n"Ilyich Ulyanov"\nbartender listened to his meaningful words and glanced at him, before moving his steps somewhere. Without saying a word, the man began to walk along the leading bartender. The bartender stopped at a door and slipped aside, as if to go in there. When the man opened the door, the attention of the people in the room was instantly focused.\nIt's an atmosphere that doesn't seem normal at all.

Bukharin's face was red as if he were very angry.\n"Obviously, you said that if I cooperate with you, you would put me in charge of the People's Commissar. But look, you put me in a low position!"\n"Comrade, I said I could, but I never said I would." Buharin trembled with anger at Trotsky's pun.\n"You had it coming."

In a country once inferior and oppressed to anyone before 1917, workers are enthusiastic about the birth of a federation waving their flags."
 Soviet.61.a:0 "Be glorified, our free Motherland"
 Soviet.62.t:0 "The Soviet Civil War"
 Soviet.62.d:0 "Russia faces another civil war after a deepening conflict between the Troika faction, which supports the New Economic Policy, and the Soviet opposition, which opposes it.\n\nBukharin and many others who oppose the tyranny of the Troika have started an uprising, and the outcome of this civil war is likely to change the fate of the Soviet significantly."
 Soviet.62.a:0 "Who will win."
 Soviet.63.t:0 "Another Revolution"
 Soviet.63.d:0 "In the middle of the speech hall, a red flag stood tall. Carved with a gold hammer and a sickle, the flag was a symbol that promised prosperity, development, and revolution for the workers. However, Yuri knew that it was a cloth stained with ash and blood. Every time the flag waved, his eyes were reminded of the faces of the countless enemies he had killed.\n\n"Comrades," shouted the young political commissioner at the podium, his voice filling the room. "Today, we have taken the first steps to heal the divisions of the past, to establish a new supreme Soviet. The world's counter-revolutionaries have said that our revolution is over, but they are wrong. The revolution is not over, it has only begun!"\n\nAll the people in the speech hall applauded, but Yuri bowed his head. The applause sounded to him like a flame burning and breaking. 'Is revolution a never-ending fight?' he asked himself."
 Soviet.63.a:0 "How much else would it take to sacrifice under this red star?"
 Soviet.64.t:0 "The New Constitution"
 Soviet.64.d:0 "The Kremlin's cellar, where the new constitution was being drafted, was filled with stifling heat. The commissioners gradually took on the shape of the constitution with hammers, as if it were a historical blacksmith. However, shouting and fistfights could be heard in a conference room full of ironclad issues.\n\n"We must not forget that we are building a new foundation for this country!" A member of the committee shouted in excitement. His hand was scrambling on the paper spread on the desk. However, the sentences left at each point where the tip of the pen passed could not be continued. To the other committee members, these were simple sentences that could collapse at any time, like a tilted tower.\n\n"Isn't that too much? I think the radical clause up to this point is going to be a problem for the future." Another pointed his finger at the desk. The "revolution" is over, but the language of the law remains unsettled and confusing. The young commissioner, red-faced and shouting "Capitalist Fracci," lunges at the desk. The provisions of the new constitution creaked and couldn't mesh like different cogs."
 Soviet.64.a:0 "What the hell kind of this is."
 Soviet.65.t:0 "Recovery"
 Soviet.65.d:0 ""Comrades! That's great news! Let's say our comrades on the front line have won!" When Ivan heard this, I couldn't remember what he had done. But I did remember the crowd cheering him on. In fact, he was a civil war, a revolution, and didn't know much about it. Isn't it the same to use the right time, whether they're both "Soviet"? But Ivan has known since his empire that, at least for now, taking sides with his defenders is how to live life without problems.\n\nFortunately, this government did meet Ivan's expectations. When the civil war ended, the government came up with a number of difficult measures that Ivan did not understand and stabilized the people's livelihoods that had been destroyed during the civil war. Of course, some people complained that it had only changed from a dilute porridge to a dilute borsch, but Ivan did not. Don't you remember the days of the Empire and the Red and White Civil War? Ivan wanted to give high marks to this government, which has at least made efforts for stability. He doesn't starve, eats three meals a day, gives him a house to avoid rain, travels around saying that it's for us, and if he can't do this, he's not a country."
 Soviet.65.a:0 "In any case, Ivan felt secure in his life."
 Soviet.66.t:0 "Under the Red Sky"
 Soviet.66.d:0 "He looked up at the sky. His entire life up to this point seemed to be beating him up like a midday rain. He resolved to always work for the people, and after shedding a lot of blood, he rose to the position.\n\n"Lenin, what should we do?"\n\nBukharin murmured quietly as he swept his head with his hand. Even though he had risen to the position of Supreme Leader. The revolution did not seem to stop yet.\n\nAbove all, he had the greatest enemy. Kaiserich in the west. The Germanic tribes that defeated both Britain and France, and overthrew even the founding Russia, which seemed immortalized. Those who humiliated us greatly with Brest Litovsk. It was obvious that they would invade the Soviet people first in the future. To prevent that, we must be strong. If you make the Soviet strong and preemptively strike Germany, you will have a chance of winning. Buharin's ideas were becoming more and more like the political opponents he hated without even realizing it.\n\nHe looked at the map. Germany oppressed the people of Ukraine, the Baltic, Belarus, and the vast land. Buharin shouted back to himself."
 Soviet.66.a:0 "Such a thing will never be repeated again."
 Soviet.67.t:0 "One Federation, Two Governments"
 Soviet.67.d:0 "The Soviet Russia, which represents the people of all Russia, is divided. It is natural that efforts toward an unfinished socialist paradise are divided in many directions. Unfortunately, today's crisis is a rather unhealthy kind. \n\nPoor socialism is backward socialism. - The New Economic Policy (NEP), harshly criticized by Nikolai Buharin, is finally getting worse. The Red Army supports it nominally, but in fact, it is clear that what they really want is not economic policy. People who have visited Moscow at least once will see factional strife on every street they walk by. This is happening both at the administrative headquarters and at the military academies. In the situation the wounds of civil war couldn't close yet, society was divided into two.\n\nOur great Soviet is not united. The federal government and the military are at loggerheads and separate factional wars are going on. No one wants to succeed Kamenev, who is bent out of trying to hold hands with everyone in the world. Amid the conflict between Bukharin and Tukhachevsky, maybe the time for choice is coming."
 Soviet.67.a:0 "There can't be two stars in Russia."
 Soviet.68.t:0 "Communist Demonstrations"
 Soviet.68.d:0 "In recent years, anti-government protests calling for communism have increased dramatically. The government sees it as an operation by outside forces, and the leading candidate is Soviet Russia. They seem to incite our workers to induce various actions that undermine our national capacity. The government's response to them seems very important."
 Soviet.68.a:0 "Crack them down hard."
 Soviet.68.b:0 "Conciliate them."
 Soviet.68.c:0 "Leave it alone."
 Soviet.69.t:0 "Stalin and His Flock"
 Soviet.69.d:0 "At around 9 a.m. today, the trial began against Stalin and his flock, who are accused of state treason and of being revisionists against Marxism. A Moscow court sentenced them to a heavy sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison, while Stalin sentenced them to 30 years in prison. The historic moment came when the center of power that once held and shook the Soviet collapsed.\n\nContrary to what many had expected, Stalin was not sentenced to death, which may indicate that Buharin was quite conciliatory. Regardless, the Soviets are once again facing a new turning point. And the subsequent trial of Trotsky is also getting a lot of attention."
 Soviet.69.a:0 "It's the right punishment for traitors."
 Soviet.70.t:0 "Zinoviev and His Flock"
 Soviet.70.d:0 "The trial began around 1 p.m. today against Zinoviev, who faces charges of state treason and violations of anti-state thought prohibition laws, and the group that follows him. A Moscow court, like the last time, sentenced him to 10 to 20 years in prison, and sentenced him to deportation.\n\nPeople's prediction that the sentence would be similar to the previous Stalin's trial was right. No one was sentenced to death in this trial, which shows that Bukharin's governance is quite paternalistic. This has greatly reduced the fear of a large-scale political purge in society."
 Soviet.70.a:0 "We have punished the traitors."
 Soviet.71.t:0 "To an Unfamiliar Foreign Land"
 Soviet.71.d:0 "Mikhail Tutschevsky stood against the stern railing. The enemy aircraft flying in the wind on board was of the same kind as those caught in the old Kremlin spire, but seemed to him to be as shabby as ever. Why- indeed, no wonder. Just as everything in Western Russia had disappeared from Brest, Mikhail had lost all his influence. The current foe was just the end of a middle-aged man in a nice uniform. There was no strength in his body.\n\nIf you look back at the last 20 or so hours, it's just full of failures. The majority of the troops refused to accept my commanders' arguments, rather they were prone to gunfire. The plans for coup in Moscow and Leningrad have long since been exposed. The most reliable deputy was a subordinate to Buharin. Could he be worse than himself today? The core of rebellion is speed. Literally, Mikhail is the quickest general in Russia to fall.\n\nHe couldn't decide what to do. He just left the port in Leningrad with his passport and a little bit of rubles. His mother, who warmly surrounds our planet, gave no answer to him. Stars are overlapping today.\n\n'There is no shadow of the white seabirds. Even in the mast,'"
 Soviet.71.a:0 "'Even in the sea around there.'"
 Soviet.72.t:0 "Military Coup"
 Soviet.72.d:0 "Early this morning, rebels led by Tukhachevsky headed to the Kremlin in Moscow. Tukhachevsky's rebels tried to cross the barricades at the Kremlin, and government forces tried to forcefully deter them. The winner of this tight battle is..."
 Soviet.72.a:0 "His plan had been leaked and he failed to take over."
 Soviet.72.b:0 "He occupied the Kremlin."
 Soviet.73.t:0 "Political Purge"
 Soviet.73.d:0 "From this morning to this evening, hearings were held against numerous politicians involved in the Bolshevik. The trials against them were summary proceedings and proceeded very quickly. Almost all of the figures were sentenced to prison, and only a few were acquitted or found not guilty. The aftermath of this purge is expected to last quite a while."
 Soviet.73.a:0 "I'm afraid."
 Soviet.74.t:0 "Enactment of Parliamentary Act"
 Soviet.74.d:0 "Yesterday afternoon, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet enacted parliamentary act. It calls for the dissolution of all parties except one party illegal. The Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Tukhachevsky, called it a "special step" to unite the divided Soviet, and the bill is expected to completely solidify Tukhachevsky's one-man dictatorship."
 Soviet.74.a:0 "The Beginning of a Dictatorship."
 Soviet.75.t:0 "Search Operation Begins"
 Soviet.75.d:0 "A large-scale search operation has begun for Bukharin. He has been missing since Tukhachevsky took over the Kremlin Palace, and Tukhachevsky has organized a large force to capture him, one of the people's closest hits."
 Soviet.75.a:0 "Will the search succeed"
 Soviet.76.t:0 "Top Secret"
 Soviet.76.d:0 "Report on the Search for Bukharin\n\n- Red Army Main Intelligence Directorate\n\n\nIn accordance with the orders of the Red Army Supreme Command, this Directorate has launched a large-scale search operation to locate former General Secretary Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin, whose whereabouts remain unknown following the coup. This report provides a summary of the operation and its findings.\n\n\n- Search completed at 47 high-priority hideouts and underground locations within Moscow\n\n- Raids conducted at 19 dachas in the Moscow suburbs (formerly reserved for high-ranking officials)\n\n- Border checkpoint surveillance intensified in anticipation of possible escape attempts abroad (including borders with Poland, Romania, and Manchuria)\n\n- 37 individuals with known ties to Bukharin detained and interrogated\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nDefinitive confirmation of survival: unavailable\n\nNo corpse or conclusive evidence of death recovered\n\nLast known sighting in Moscow:\n\nShortly after midnight on the day of the coup, a man was reportedly seen near the Kremlin with a gunshot wound, but the time and circumstances do not align with the timeline of the uprising"
 Soviet.76.a:0 "That means… where the hell is he, then?"
 Soviet.77.t:0 "Didn't Make a Successful Search"
 Soviet.77.d:0 "Eventually, the search party could not find Bukharin. Without Bukharin, a trial was held against his flock in Moscow, and Bukharin and his flock were sentenced to death or imprisonment. Bukharin was sentenced to death but was not actually executed because he could not be found."
 Soviet.77.a:0 "Trial about Bukharin without Bukharin..."
 Soviet.78.t:0 "Execute Kollontai"
 Soviet.78.d:0 "This morning, there was the execution of Kollontai, who was sentenced to death for treason. He was one of the key figures in the Bukharin government and one of the leading 'traitors' from Tukhachevsky. His execution demonstrated to the public the establishment of a world of Tukhachevsky."
 Soviet.78.a:0 "Goodbye."
 Soviet.79.t:0 "Troika Punishment"
 Soviet.79.d:0 "This morning, a formal trial was held against the Troikas. Stalin, Trotsky and Zinoviev were sentenced to death, while other Trojans were sentenced to decades in prison. It illustrated the fall of the Bolshevik Central Powers in the past."
 Soviet.79.a:0 "Power disappears in a day."
 Soviet.80.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective]-Sponsored Rallies in the Capital"
 Soviet.80.d:0 "A number of political groups have announced rallies in the capital this week. They don't seem to have any specific grievances they want to air, beyond a general sense that we should try to improve our relations with [FROM.GetNameDef], and remove any politicians critical of the [FROM.GetAdjective] administration from any positions of power.\n\nWhile it is possible that these demonstrations are just spontaneous manifestations of the popular opinion, it is at least remarkable that a number of key organizers travelled to [FROM.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] recently, and seemed to have begun agitating for this upon their return."
 Soviet.80.a:0 "Well, that is certainly their right."

 Soviet.81.t:0 "Soviet Russia's call to participate in anti-German front"
 Soviet.81.d:0 "Soviet Russia has asked us to secretly participate in the anti-German front, along with a request for arms aid. It seems that they, like us, also have a vengeance to take revenge on Germany. A secret agreement with them seems to be of great interest to us."
 Soviet.81.a:0 "Great!"
 Soviet.81.b:0 "We don't need them."
 Soviet.82.t:0 "France agreed to our request"
 Soviet.82.d:0 "The French government agreed to form an anti-German front with us and gave us thousands of infantry equipment, which is very good news for us and will be a step towards taking down Germany."
 Soviet.82.a:0 "They are wise friends."
 Soviet.83.t:0 "France rejected our request"
 Soviet.83.d:0 "The French government rejected all our requests. They don't seem to have any intention of working with us to attack Germany. This is not very good news."
 Soviet.83.a:0 "We're good enough for ourselves, too."
 Soviet.84.t:0 "Coup in Moscow"
 Soviet.84.d:0 "Foreign media in Moscow reported on the shootout at dawn. Martial law was imposed in the Western Russian military districts and party forces were established in two of Russia's most iconic cities. General Mikhail Nikolajevich Tutschevsky was seen entering the Kremlin, and international politics pointed to him as a political upheaval.\n\nThe 'most revolutionary general in all Russia' was considered the heavyweight of the Red Army. Arguments are being made over whether his coup d'etat was accidental or long-prepared. But the majority agree: Soviet civil control failed. The German ambassador to Moscow had no comment on today's situation. Many are paying attention to whether the Berlin-Moscow relationship will be affected."
 Soviet.84.a:0 "Finally, it happened."
 Soviet.85.t:0 "Night of Disbelief"
 Soviet.85.d:0 "On a dark night in Moscow, a man was looking at the night sky at the Kremlin Palace. The man, Bukharin, thought deeply about something, as if he were deep in thought. Tukhachevsky, Bukharin had that name in his mind again and again already.\nHe said he would win the civil war and build a country for workers, but recently the Red Army's Tukhachevsky was unhappy with his policies.\n\n'Something bad is happening'\n\nHe thought.\nNo, even if nothing happens, he must be a dangerous man. It may be a predetermined fate to remove Tukhachevsky from his position."
 Soviet.85.a:0 "Getting rid of him has become a necessity."
 Soviet.86.t:0 "Have an axe to grind"
 Soviet.86.d:0 "Soviet Russian army general Tukhachevsky was deeply troubled under the nightfall of Moscow.\nThe present government, the Bukharin government, is only trying to do something dangerous to join hands with our enemies France and Britain, out of vengeance against Germany. He clenched his fists as if he had decided. \n\n"He have to be taken down."\n\nIf you leave him alone, eventually the Soviets will be overthrown by capitalist-controlled states, he thought that the only way to save Russia was to bring him down as quickly and as quickly as possible."
 Soviet.86.a:0 "For Motherland."
 Soviet.87.t:0 "From the Intelligence Agency"
 Soviet.87.d:0 "Just a few minutes ago, the Intelligence Agency received shocking news: Tukhachevsky and his cronies may be preparing for a coup. In response, the Intelligence Agency has obtained some evidence. Nevertheless, while there is no conclusive evidence or evidence yet, their misconduct is sufficient to suspect it and will require further investigation into Tukhachevsky. If their coup plot is certain, they will have to come up with measures to counteract it."
 Soviet.87.a:0 "I knew it."
 Soviet.88.t:0 "Plan a Strategy"
 Soviet.88.d:0 "Successful coups require a thorough operation. We must develop an operational plan so that our army can quickly seize the supreme soviet, paralyze the functioning of the parliament, and simultaneously attack and capture the Kremlin. And we must be able to capture the supreme council and Bukharin, remove them from power, and quickly establish our government."
 Soviet.88.a:0 "Let's get it started."
 Soviet.89.t:0 "Death of Kamenev!"
 Soviet.89.d:0 "By this time, no idealist predicted that Kamenev would survive, but no one thought the day would come so soon either. His efforts to stabilize the Soviet Russia by uniting the various factions within it fell to a single assassin's bullet.\n\nKamenev then held on until the New Year of '36, as if he had something to say, before dying five days later today. The entire Soviet is in mourning, and Kamenev's funeral was held with state honors. A troika collective leadership system was established to try to stabilize the chaos caused by Kamenev's death, and while some workers' opposition opposed it, their voices were drowned out by their relative minority."

But to no surprise, they were met with resistance ever since the Troika's etsablishment, and if they will actually seize the leadership succesfully is now the question, as a battle between all those who want to decide the Republic's future breaks out."

The two-headed eagle-as Pyotr Stolypin said, one eagle overlooking Western Russia and the Far East was enough. There was no need to decentralize power. A single power was enough to deal with the 'revolutionary molecules.' And so the revolution was born.\n\nIosif Stalin wasn't the protagonist of the revolution - Comrade Lenin, who had already died, was the one who brought down the Russian system. He was just a worker who supported the revolution, just like his comrades in the Central Committee. A financier of the Leninist faction? Could he have left such a huge footprint? The Soviet Rush was built with the cooperation of Comrade Lenin and Trotsky. Zinoviev is also trying to build and expand his own power. Even though he had risen to the position of secretary, it was no different from the end-of-life regime.\n\nI have to conspire. I have to get rid of Zinoviev, who cries out for a permanent revolution after seeing the carnage in London and Paris, and of Trotsky, who wants to build a country for himself and not for the people. If they provoke a war that is not necessary, Russia, and the Russian people, will be mercilessly dealt with.\n\nI do it because we have to. I do it because no one else can, and millions of people would die if we didn't. But you don't think that's a good enough reason."

Inside was an old Order of St. Vladimir—a symbol of the Tsar, long mocked by revolutionary faith. But it was also the first token that proved a person named Mikhail Tukhachevsky ever existed.

He wanted to hurl every enemy of the revolution into the fires of hell. He believed every nation was an enemy of the Soviet Union. Bukharin believed the same. Then why was he trying to cast him aside? Same enemies, same war, same army—the same?\n\nOnly then did Tukhachevsky understand Bukharin. Of course—Bukharin was thinking exactly what Tukhachevsky had been thinking. Only I can do this. Only I must hold everything. If not, everything will collapse. No one—not a single soul—must be allowed to get in my way…\n\nBukharin hadn’t insulted him. He had simply done the reasonable thing. But the one crushed beneath that reason just so happened to be Tukhachevsky.\n\nAt that moment, the shame he felt—not for being cast aside, but for understanding Bukharin and agreeing with his logic—was greater than his rage.\n\nTukhachevsky grabbed the receiver at once.

The other was the Red Bonaparte. Mikhail Tukhachevsky—his eyes were like a pine tree that could take root nowhere, and the paranoid fear and rage within them could be felt even by Shostakovich.\n\n"Dmitri," Tukhachevsky began. "The imperialists we must confront are not simply 'foreign nations.' They are a fate to be met with gunfire and flame."\n\n"But..." Shostakovich spoke quietly. His voice was faint and cold, like frost settling on the window. "Mikhail, the future you speak of is nothing more than a composition played in blood. A war concerto filled with untuned screams brings comfort to no one!"\n\n"Comfort?" Tukhachevsky raised his voice and stood from his chair. There was a blade-like emotion at the edge of his words. "We don’t fight for comfort. We must destroy everything—so that we may survive!"\n\nShostakovich fell silent. His gaze drifted to somewhere far away. "Mikhail, you said it yourself—you fight to survive. But who exactly are you surviving from?" "Those damned imperialists, of course. Anyone not on Russia’s side. How do you still not see it? They are plotting in secret, building the schemes that will one day tear our republic to pieces!"\n\nFor a moment, no words were exchanged in the room. Only the last embers in the fireplace crackled softly. And then, it was Tukhachevsky who exploded. "Get out!" he shouted. His voice was heavy and sharp, like the march of jackboots. "How dare a mere musician mock my ideology? I am the Supreme Leader of the Soviet Union, Marshal of the Red Army, the thunder god of socialism!"\n\nShostakovich stood in silence. That silence was old and heavy, like dust resting on a bookshelf. He slowly looked around the room one last time. In his gaze was the regret of a final note—an unspoken farewell. Then he closed the door. Click. As if the sound marked the end of an entire era.\n\nTukhachevsky was left alone. His hands were still trembling.

I can write decently myself. In any case, comrade, your writing is patriotic, revolutionary—and passionate. Reminds me of someone I know—” Shostakovich. That friend, tucked away somewhere in the back of his mind. Why had he forgotten him? Tukhachevsky’s thoughts were suddenly pulled back to their last conversation. He remembered himself shouting, Get out. And Shostakovich, walking away without so much as a word. He wondered now what the composer would think of this “holy war” song. In truth, Tukhachevsky had once thought of entrusting him with such pieces—marches, anthems. He couldn't do that anymore. “Marshal?” Lebedev-Kumach’s voice brought Tukhachevsky back to the present."

The folds of his uniform carried the weight of long-past winters, and the jingling pile of golden medals seemed burdened with the silence of dead soldiers.

That chord was not an answer, but a warning, a lament, and a final courtesy.\n\n“The war is over, Mikhail.”\n“Dmitri, but the end is just another name for the beginning. Now it’s time to write the final movement. A composition of total victory—with no dissonance.”\nShostakovich finally stopped playing. He slowly raised his eyes. There was no longer any trace in Tukhachevsky’s gaze of the man who had once politely helped a shabby music teacher. \n\n“You say you’ll write the final movement? Then I shall play no more.”\nTukhachevsky nodded. In his eyes, there was no disappointment or anger. Only the calm of someone letting go.\n\n“I expected as much. That’s why you’ll remain here.”\nHe neatly adjusted the hem of his coat as he spoke.\n\n“Everything is already in motion. Operation Thunder God. The final strike that will eliminate the last remaining ‘enemy’ from this world. I don’t know when it will come. Perhaps it never will. Perhaps continuing to live each day as if forever facing the ‘enemy’ isn’t such a bad thing—like a piece of music that never ends.

Welding sparks sliced through the flesh of metal and burst forth, while blocks of iron slowly transformed into tanks. Among these monsters with hearts of steel stood one—black, heavy, and immense—the KV-1, exhaling thick, wordless breaths under the sunlight. Its shell was still cold, but soon, it would burn with the fury of war. Artyom, as always, held tools in his oil-stained hands, but on this day, something unusual happened: beyond the perimeter fence of the depot, an old man appeared, clad in a ragged overcoat.\n\n“Hey, comrade. You’re not allowed here without clearance—”\nWhen Artyom approached and spoke, the old man quietly smiled and pulled from inside his coat a worn piece of cloth. Medals glittered upon it. Some bore the marks of Imperial Russia, while others were engraved with the hammer and sickle.\n“I saw this country born in blood,” he said. “Held my ground in the trenches, biting through German bullets, and crawled under the hooves of White cavalry on the streets of Leningrad.” His voice was rough as carved earth, each word dust-laden.\n\nSlowly, he raised his head and looked up at the KV-1. The tank under welding radiated majesty, as though it were a god being carved in iron.\n“If we’d had something like this… if this steel beast had stood in place of the wooden rifles we raised in the square…”\nA thick fog settled in his eyes.\n“Maybe the Germans wouldn’t have kept the revolution inside Russia. Maybe they wouldn’t have even had the chance to tear us apart… who knows.”\nHe trailed off, staggering as he reached for the barbed wire and rested his hand upon it.\n\nArtyom watched him silently. To him, war and revolution had always meant poster images and speeches by marshals. But now, looking at the deep lines in the old man’s face and the collapse in his shoulders, he began to understand what those words truly meant.\n“We...” he said quietly. “This time will be different, comrade. We have tanks instead of rifles, and a factory instead of a shattered palace.”\nHe tapped the steel plate with his oil-smeared fingers.\n“This time, we’ll win.

His legs trembled uneasily, and his cane struck the ground like a remnant of the past. One eye was clouded, and his face was not merely wrinkled but cracked, like a fractured statue. “I...” He stopped before Tukhachevsky, his breath creaking like a rusted cannon. “I was one of those who called for arms against Germany—under the banner of the Russian Empire. I was an enemy of the Red Banner. Of this cause. Of yours, Marshal.” Tukhachevsky narrowed his eyes, then silently extended a hand. The old man hesitated, then took it. The Marshal’s grip was as solid as stone. “Marshal, I don’t deserve this handshake. I lived as an enemy of communism.” Tukhachevsky smiled quietly—not the smile of a man in power, but of one who had crossed a blood-soaked era. “War taught me one thing. It doesn’t matter whose side you fought on. What matters is who stands beside you now. I was born a noble, fought in the imperial army. And yet here I stand. And so do you. Don’t be ashamed. The past may lead us, but that doesn’t mean we must be dragged by it against our will.” Behind them, the reporters snapped their photos. The handshake was recorded—not as history, but as choreography; not as sincerity, but as evidence. The cameras captured their faces, but not their eyes.

In his view, the very existence of the NEP sacrifices the working class while favoring the peasantry.\n\nBukharin’s speeches have received significant support from certain groups, which has been perceived as a warning sign by the Party leadership.\n\nStalin regarded Bukharin’s claims as an attempt to dismantle the bureaucracy, while Trotsky believed they directly conflicted with his own vision of revolutionary military doctrine. Zinoviev also expressed concern that Bukharin’s call for a stronger dictatorship of the proletariat would hinder the Party’s ability to expand its broader appeal.\n\nThe Central Committee must now decide whether to integrate this dangerous radical faction within the institutional framework to exert control, or to exclude and confront them outright. One thing is certain—Bukharin’s actions have moved beyond ideological disagreement and now represent a direct challenge to the Party’s leadership."

Though informal, it was clear to every delegate that the balance of power had shifted.\n\nHowever, this Troika was not a newly emerged power structure but rather a recalibration of existing authority. Trotsky was already in command of the Red Army, holding firm control over the military. Zinoviev, as the chairman of the Comintern, occupied a crucial position in the international socialist movement. Stalin, for his part, maintained dominance over the Party apparatus and bureaucracy, wielding great influence over internal affairs and regional appointments.\n\nThe three entered into a temporary alliance to counter the growing momentum of Bukharin and the radical Workers’ Opposition. The Party leadership either tacitly endorsed or quietly tolerated this emergency coalition. Yet this was not unity—it was a balance of necessity. Each member of the Troika sought to solidify his own position, and no one could say with confidence who would ultimately emerge as the true heir of the revolution.\n\nThe current calm is only surface-deep. The halls of the Kremlin remain silent, but within them are eyes gauging who will draw the first knife.

Across the long oak table, men who had once sworn death to the other now sat in cautious deliberation. On one side, the envoys of the German Empire, adorned in crisp feldgrau and speaking in measured tones of realpolitik. On the other, the representatives of Arkhangelsky’s forces, weary from years in the underground, now grasping at the lifeline dangled before them.\n\nThe Germans had come with an offer—arms, munitions, even ‘advisors’ willing to oversee the destruction of Bolshevism. Aiding a band of desperate reactionaries was a small price to pay for maintaining the eastern peace and ensuring the continued sanctity of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In exchange, the Whites would vow to uphold the old borders of 1918, ceding Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic to German dominion.\n\nArkhangelsky’s emissaries did not recoil. This was the devil’s bargain they had long expected. To save Holy Russia, they would have to abandon parts of her forever. The room sat in silence as the weight of the decision bore down upon them. To refuse meant a lonely war, outgunned and outnumbered. To accept meant victory at the cost of national humiliation.\n\nAt last, a weary voice cut through the silence. "We shall consider your terms." The German envoy merely smiled."

 soviet_rework_white.065.d:0 "The war between Germany and Russia, which began a year earlier, has come to an end. After Germany's total victory in World War II, the lands west of the Urals became part of White Russia, which had collaborated with them. However, Russia was effectively a German colony, and Denikin and his faction rebelled, declaring independence from Germany. Germany immediately declared war, but in the aftermath of World War I and the failure of its operations, it was unable to bring Russia to heel and eventually declared an end to the war.\n\nThis seemed to stall Germany's seemingly unstoppable expansion of hegemony, and was a major blow to German pride. Russia, on the other hand, would become a land entirely of Russians."

 soviet_rework_white.067.d:0 "A general election was held in Russia, which recently won independence from Germany. Following Viktor Chernov's opinion, Denikin began to move to make Russia a democratic country and declared that a general election was the first step toward that end.\n\nParty of Socialist-Revolutionaries won a landslide victory in the general election. Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries is one of Russia's left-wing parties, and experts believe that one of the reasons for their victory is that the Russian people have become left-leaning under the long rule of the Bolsheviks."

 soviet_rework_white.069.d:0 "The people of Russia had been oppressed by the Tsar for hundreds of years, and in 1917, they finally succeeded in overthrowing him. Now, it seemed, an era was dawning for the Russian people.\n\nHowever, the political situation in Russia was chaotic, and the ongoing war with Germany left the country in a tight spot. The Bolsheviks didn't miss a beat: they launched an uprising to overthrow the Russian Republic, and they succeeded, forcing the people of Russia to once again live under Bolshevik tyranny.\n\nArkhangelsky and his cabal, who set out to save Russia from the tyranny of the Bolsheviks, were no different: they were a bunch of traitors ruling Russia on the strength of Germany.\n\nBut all of that is now in the past tense. General Denikin rose up against Arkhangelsky, toppled their government, fought off the German invasion, and made Russia a fully independent country. The country held general elections and took steps toward democracy. The rose that had been so terribly trampled upon, blossomed once again. A rose that would never fall, bloomed in the fields of Russia."

 soviet_rework_white.070.d:0 "Now that Arkhangelsky had been purged and Russia had achieved full independence from Germany, a massive political purge began in Russia. Fearing a political vacuum, Peshkov focused his executions on those closely associated with Arkhangelsky, as there were numerous other important Russian figures who had collaborated with Germany in the past.\n\nThe purge was widely supported by the Russian public, although some criticized the fact that it failed to root out all pro-German elements. However, current trends suggest that the complete elimination of pro-German elements is unlikely."

 soviet_rework_white.071.d:0 "Today, a new Russian government is in place, one that fired all the key players in the old pro-authoritarian Arkhangelsky government and is made up of the generals who were closest to Denikin and contributed to Russia's independence from Germany. Some people saw them as rogues who, like Arkhangelsky, would use dictatorship to hold on to power. Of course, many of them have since disappeared or have been found dead. Now Russia has a new government, and the glory will last forever."

Since the days of the Decembrist, Moscow's citizens know what they're up against, and how dangerous it is to insult the emperor.\n\nThe Russian Empire collapsed in 1917. Many gnashed their teeth at Germany for raping Eastern Europe. After the Kerensky Offensive ended in bloody failure, a socialist uprising broke out. 'Chief of Staff' Arkhangelsky joined the Red Army after several moves. The weary man believed they would set this Russia right once again.\n\nAnd so the weary man's hopes came to an end. Instead of regaining their old glory, they wasted their time in their own power struggle. Disappointed, he joined hands with an anti-communist warlord. The White Army would waste no time in fulfilling his dream.\n\n...And, and there was so much going on. His troops withdrew from Ukraine. They withdrew from Crimea. They withdrew from Russia. And it looked like most of them would never set foot on their home soil again.\n\nThe Toxin War had been fought and the opportunity had come. By joining hands with Berlin, they had the means to liberate Russia. 'Commander-in-Chief Arkhangelsk' cried out to his Russian compatriots scattered across Germany, Poland, and countless other countries: 'It's time to return to our cozy homes!\n\nLeague of All-Russian Liberation had succeeded in liberating Russia, quite literally. It was a miracle, and Moscow was abuzz with celebrants, and peace had arrived. It didn't take long for that peace to give way to unspeakable tensions. Factional fighting-the very causes that had disappointed him in the Soviet Russia-had overtaken the new Russia. This time, there was no escaping them.\n\nAnd now, the exhausted man sits in his Kremlin office. His accomplishments in crushing the Denikin faction and establishing an ironclad authority will never fade; the people support his every move, at least on the surface. And as long as that support doesn't fade, so will his power.\n\nAlexei Arkhangelsky gazed out over downtown Moscow in silence. Peace -beautiful peace. It was the only thing he'd ever wanted since he'd enlisted in the loyal army of Nicholas I. And he just wanted to enjoy it."

The atrocities committed by the Soviets in Alapayevsk and Petropavlovsk will never be forgotten. Any attempt to break the sacred Romanov bloodline will not be tolerated.\n\nAnd after a long time, Mother Russia is back to her old self. The czar resides in the altitudes of the nations and gives dinners to foreign ambassadors. Socialists and left-wingers were buried in Siberia, in the forests where no one knew them. The name of the Russian Empire swept across Western Russia and the Far East.\n\nBusinessmen in Berlin and Vienna scramble to make connections with St. Petersburg and Moscow. People scoff at the knight's tale of the fear of Russia by the Great Western colonizers. Though torn apart, Russia has risen from the ashes and reasserted its power over a territory more vast than ever before.\n\nKirillovich declared as he removed the star from the Kremlin bell tower. Russia, which has died and risen countless times since the fall of Rus' shining culture, will live forever. Even if the nightmare of the Great Khan is reversed, the soul of the nation will not die.\n\nIs there a subject on the Russian soil who would deny it? We will cherish this freedom forever."

 soviet_rework_white.074.d:0 "Zinovy Mikhailovich Sverdlov is an iconic figure of a Jewish family in the late 19th century. His family was scattered at an early age, and a young Zinovy traveled to the United States, where he met Maxim Gorky. When Vladivostok was engulfed in the fires of war in 1905, Tsar Nicholas I wanted all Russians to join the fight.  Alienated from Gorky and alienated from Russia, Zinovy traveled to the French embassy and enlisted in the Foreign Legion. It was the beginning of a military career that would underpin his authority.\n\nThirty years later, his native country regained its independence. The Soviets picked up where the empire had fallen, and the Russians, again, raised their spears against them. The Germans were pushed back in bewilderment, trembling at the Russian might. Zinovy, now the right-hand man of Denikin, the Iron Man, was given a chance at power, and he quickly realized it: Many people would question whether even the descendant of the Iron Man was capable of being an Iron Man.\n\nThe Russian Republic is a democracy. We have elections, we have a parliament, and we have a lot of interaction with the great powers, but every Russian knows. The military, the military led by the Iron Man, has never relinquished power, and the military led by Zinovy has no intention of doing so.\n\nThe military functions as a party. It's called the Shinobi's cabal. They will fight for their power, they will give and receive small bribes... but they will work for Russia. That's what Anton Denikin did, and that's what Zinovy Mikhailovich Sverdlov will do.\n\nThe military doesn't work for the government. The military works for Zinovy. Zinovy works for Russia."
