 FRA_Georges_Valois_desc:0 "As the leader of National Syndicalism, Georges Valois stands at the center of French politics. While advancing leftist socio-economic reforms, he remains deeply rooted in patriotism, acting as both a balancer and unifier between revolution and militarism. Valois advocates for a strong centralized state and seeks to incorporate labor unions into the core of the political order to institutionalize class conflict within France. A philosophical leader driving the country’s modernization, Valois recognizes both Doriot’s populist fervor and Bucard’s militarism, yet pursues a path that synthesizes their extremes."

 FRA_jacques_doriot_desc:0 "People describe Jacques Doriot in many different ways. Some call him a great leader of France; others denounce him as a reactionary or an enemy of democracy. But why should it matter what they call him? Doriot once dreamed of a People's Republic united under one banner, striving toward the ideals of communism. But after opposing the expulsion of Pierre Monatte and being expelled himself, Doriot died—at least in spirit. He cried out, 'Why?' again and again, yet no answer came. Time passed.\n\nAnd Doriot 'fell'. But does a man abandon love just because it is blocked? Doriot loved communism. He descended into madness, torn between his love and fury for the cause. And at last—like Pygmalion falling in love with his statue—he created his Galatea: a new ideology he named National Popular Socialism.\n\nFrance, too, had its pride.\n\nFrance had its revolutions, its people’s history, and its dream of being great and powerful.\n\nNow Doriot has a new dream.\n\nA strong France, threatened by no one, towering above all others and ruling the world with an iron fist. A proud people living in a proud nation—and himself, glorified as the leader of that great nation. Even if the path he walks leads to hell, he does not care. For a man madly in love, destiny is worthless.\n\nLong live France and the world, long live the Leader, long live France."
 FRA_jacques_doriot_desc_puppet:0 "There are many words used to describe Jacques Doriot. Some call him the great leader of France, some a reactionary, others an enemy of democracy. And now, he is called a 'puppet.' Once, Doriot dreamed of a republic of the people, united together, and strove for the ideals of communism. Yet when he was expelled alongside Monatte, whom he refused to denounce, Doriot died as a man. He cried out, 'Why?' again and again, but never found an answer, and time marched on. Doriot 'decayed.' But can a man abandon love simply because he is blocked? Doriot 'loved' communism. His love and his fury for it consumed him. And at last—like Pygmalion who adored his statue—he crafted a Galatea of his own, called Popular Socialism.\nBut Doriot failed.\n\nHe still stands at the podium. His voice still pours from newspapers and radios. He still sits in the black chair of the presidential office. But that is all.\n\nThe dream of being the leader of a great nation, adored by a great people, has utterly crumbled. Now, signing what the fools loyal to Marcel Déat demand, reading their speeches, staring blankly as he is paraded at countless ceremonies—Doriot is consumed by seething rage. He has taken to drowning himself in drink, in drugs, and in every indulgence a man can seize. The doctors mouth empty assurances of good health at every examination, but Doriot knows his body is collapsing. Does it matter? Who is to blame? The fools of Déat and his cronies who control him? Or Doriot himself, who allowed them to? Now he clings only to the scraps of Déat’s mercy, grasping at whatever pleasures remain to him.\n\nLong live France and the world, long live the Leader, long live France."
 FRA_charles_maurras_desc:0 "The Lonely Giant — perhaps the most fitting epithet for Charles Maurras. At first, Maurras believed that the Republic was the only system suited for France. Yet, as the Republic sank deeper into the mire, he fiercely denounced it for turning French citizens into mere puppets of administrators, rather than free subjects of the nation. For him, the greatness of France lay in her regional diversity and her traditions. Every attempt by the Republic to centralize power around Paris was nothing less than an act of self-destruction.\n\nThe organic unity of the French nation and the restoration of its traditional order, he believed, were the only paths by which the homeland could be made strong again. His agnostic convictions led to his blacklisting by Pope Pius XI in 1926, a blow that dealt lasting harm to his movement. Yet, in the end, Maurras emerged as the helmsman who would steer France forward.\n\nMaurras consistently championed the vision of “a France for all,” lending legitimacy to a state that had long claimed the right to dominate its subjects while insisting that those subjects, too, were French. His only desire is the rebirth of the French nation. But his ideals are so unyielding, so unwilling to compromise, that without careful preparation, he may one day find himself swept away by the turbulent currents of history..."
 FRA_jean_iii_desc:0 "Jean III was destined to bear the weight of the crown, yet his life was filled with a tragic contradiction—an unceasing desire to serve his country, and the cruel reality of being denied the chance to do so. The Republic granted him residence, but forbade him the privilege of wearing a uniform. Thus, he sought indirect ways to contribute to France, even traveling to Denmark to study the art of arms manufacturing. When the Great War broke out, his loyalty to the homeland grew only more fervent. He yearned to enlist, but was once again refused, devoting himself instead to Red Cross work and offering his own estate as a hospital. Yet France’s resistance ended in failure, and the homeland he loved so dearly chose suicide, drenched in blood.\n\nAs a claimant to the throne, he cooperated with Action Française, nurturing the dream of a royal restoration. Many assumed he would live and die as just another of Europe’s countless pretenders. But that was not to be his fate. Charles Maurras and Action Française succeeded in overthrowing the Republic. Sadly, Jean III’s frail body may not endure long enough to witness fully the rebirth of the dream he had cherished for so long. Yet for him, even the chance to see his kingdom restored is enough.\n\nJean III waits. When France’s old enemies, the demons who had once ravaged his homeland, weaken, he will hurl every last ounce of strength left in his aged frame into reclaiming what belongs by right to all Frenchmen—‘France and the World.’"
 FRA_henry_vi_desc:0 "Henri VI ascended the throne after the late King Jean III and now bears the sacred weight of France’s crown. His Majesty, upon witnessing the suffering of the French people who starved while the privileged classes gorged themselves in decadence, underwent a profound moral awakening.\n\nHis Majesty devoted himself to the study of law, mathematics, and science, seeking to understand why the citizens of Paris lived in conditions worse than those of Moroccans. For a brief moment, he placed hope in Jacques Doriot, who had risen as a supposed champion of the workers, but that pretender failed miserably, like a sparrow that tears its legs trying to follow a stork, and the flag of the Republic was at last pulled down by righteous young men. It was then that the late King Jean III, leading his soldiers, struck fear into the proud German eagle, tearing its beak asunder and scattering its armies. The Germans fled in despair, but His Late Majesty, in the frailty of his age, could not preserve his life, and thus he passed away.\n\nNow Henri VI takes the throne. Like his predecessor, he is advised by Charles Maurras, with whom he seeks to chart a new path for the kingdom—one that preserves both the dignity of the crown and the joy of the people. The King acts as mediator, showing benevolence by calling referenda to hear the voice of the masses, a gesture that fills his subjects with joy, for they are guided by a monarch who ponders the future of France. Unlike his late predecessor, who hesitated to accept Maurras’ counsel that even Black men should be honored with the glory of being called French, Henri VI embraces this vision wholeheartedly, dreaming of a world where all peoples may live in dignity. His Majesty Henri VI now pledges to rebuild fallen France, to lead it forward, and to establish a free kingdom destined to endure a thousand years."

 SOV_mikhail_tukhachevsky_desc:0 "He was born in 1893, between Nikolai and Mavra, father and mother. A man who opened his eyes between the white and red banners, just before the flames of Sarajevo erupted. A descendant of fallen nobility. Mikhail Tukhachevsky. But when people speak his name, they often feel a chill. It's not just because he is the Marshal of the Red Army. It's because in his eyes flickers the silhouette of "betrayal", and in his ears echoes the unceasing whisper of "conspiracy".\n\nInvading German troops, betrayed soldiers and people. A betrayed revolution. A betrayed Russia. To Tukhachevsky, the world after the end of the Weltkrieg and the completion of the Russian Revolution appeared filled with devils, sharpening their blades to crack its fragile shell. Diplomacy was a veiled invasion, trade a prelude to the penetration of corrupt imperialist culture, and alliances were no more than sinister acts of collusion. Tukhachevsky came to a grim realization: the Soviet Union had never once been truly loved. And so, it must stand upon fear.\n\nUnder this belief, he made himself into a fortress—barbed wire in all directions, legions of marching steel, and birds overhead. Only the unified, disciplined labor of workers, all devoted to total war. Russia would become a grand total war machine. And before the enemies could invade her, she must strike first, crushing their imperialist ambitions. Tukhachevsky would become the master of these machines until the day every enemy was gone.\n\nHe is neither a monster, nor a Red Napoleon. He is the god of a red-hot iron machine."

 FRA_marcel_bucard_desc:0 "The embodiment of French Legionarism, Marcel Bucard prioritizes absolute loyalty and discipline to the state. Rather than traditional politics, he builds power through the military, militias, and private armed groups, identifying both socialism and liberalism as ideological enemies through his staunch anti-communism. Bucard openly embraces militarism and anti-Semitism, maintaining an authoritarian worldview to justify his vision of rule. His political organization, the Légionnaristes, operates more like an armed corps than a party, declaring its willingness to use extreme measures for France’s moral regeneration and territorial defense."

 FRA_marcel_bucard_desc:0 "During the Great War, Marcel Bucard fought on the front lines and earned numerous honors, including the Légion d'honneur. After the war, he felt deep disappointment in the chaos and incompetence of the politicians of the French Republic. Amidst the disorder, Bucard founded the 'Francist Movement' and emerged onto the front stage of French politics. He insisted that Greater France must be rebuilt through a strong leader and complete national unification. The image of Francist Movement members marching with Roman salutes left a deep impression on many French citizens.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Pétain government, Jacques Doriot seized power, but his administration also fell into political failure and deadlock, and France once again descended into ruinous chaos and ineptitude. Eventually, the military, along with many Catholics and Francist militiamen who had remained silent, kicked open the doors of the presidential residence in Paris and elected Marcel Bucard as the lord who would lead the fortress called France.\n\nBucard is dreaming. Dreaming of restoring the territories of Greater France, and of standing against the Germans who block France’s path, against plutocratic politics, and against the reactionary worshippers of the 'Eight Bastards.' Bucard knows that if France collapses again, it will burn once more. What must be done to prevent this? The answer lies in the Bible Bucard always carries close to his heart.\n\n"You must show no pity to the peoples the Lord your God is giving you. You must utterly destroy them and not serve their gods, for they will become a snare to you. Do not bring a detestable thing into your house, or you will be set apart for destruction like it. Regard it as utterly vile and detest it, for it is set apart for destruction.""

 FRA_marcel_deat_desc:0 "Marcel Déat calls himself a 'revolutionary.' Naturally, many dismiss this as nonsense—because to them, he's nothing more than a dictator and an authoritarian. Déat scoffs at their criticisms. After all, what revolutionary ever triumphed by chasing only ideals? History has shown us time and again that idealistic fools tend to meet the most pathetic ends. Of course, most of Déat's justifications aren’t particularly convincing either—but he has always preferred a noble lie to a disgraceful truth.\nHe joined forces with Doriot to secure France’s prosperous future. Yet once thrust into the frontline of politics, Déat found himself face to face with the pathetic, rotting weakness of so-called 'Mass Socialism.'\n\nNow, having manipulated, coerced, and crushed every coward in his path, Déat stands overlooking Paris. He has entered the final stage. There will be no more political parties, no more assemblies, no more elections. Nothing will remain in France but Marcel Déat and his 'National Popular Union.' Under the banner of Neo-Socialism, the French people must unite and finally escape the empty despair of democracy.\nContrary to what his critics believe, this isn’t some impossible fantasy. If Déat and his followers can achieve true solidarity through Neo-Socialism, they will not merely stand beside Marianne—they will wrench her neck and take her place at the front. But should they fail, they’ll find themselves at the very end of a long line—right behind the ghosts of aristocrats and kings who lost their heads to the guillotine."

 FRA_francois_de_la_rocque_desc:0 "He was once a soldier who led the Croix de Feu and commanded the streets. Yet his ideals paled before the grim reality of a broken Republic. When Doriot and Déat became mired in political deadlock, the ensuing chaos threatened to turn France once more into the sick man of Europe.\n\nDe la Rocque stood under the banner of the ‘Party of Republican Order’ alongside the towering figure of Charles de Gaulle, but their paths had long since diverged. While de Gaulle championed a strong leader to rescue France in crisis, de la Rocque became the ‘beacon of the Republicans,’ determined to defend the last rampart of the crumbling Republic. Though he had never claimed that parliament’s authority should be absolute, the sheer madness of others gave him a relatively parliamentary hue. Now, having achieved one of the most unlikely political victories since Doriot’s rule, President de la Rocque seeks ways to give hope to Jews, colonial subjects, and all those of humble origin, to unite Catholic brethren, to embrace not just the few but all, and to strangle the Weltreich into submission in the making of a new France.\n\nNow, as President, de la Rocque stands in a position to fulfill the dream he had defended even while being called a ‘traitor to the Right’ and a ‘Jewish spy.’ Liberty, equality, fraternity, and the war of civilization against barbarism.\n“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.”"

 FRA_pierre_monatte_desc:0 "Pierre Monatte was one of the great figures of revolutionary syndicalism, a man who burned with unyielding conviction at the heart of France’s turbulent labor movement. He had every right to call himself not merely an agitator, but a true revolutionary who dreamed of the emancipation of the working class and threw his entire being into making that ideal a reality. Enduring years of arrests and imprisonment, he steeled his beliefs and raised his voice against war even as the Great War raged. Within the CGT, he refused to follow the mainstream path, becoming the rallying point for the opposition. In 1919 he founded the ‘Revolutionary Syndicalist Committees,’ declaring that the labor movement must strive for revolution rather than compromise. For his radical actions he was again imprisoned in 1920, yet this only fueled his determination further.\n\nNow the red flag once again waves over Paris, and the Internationale resounds through the streets. Monatte’s conviction is as firm as ever, but the world has changed. Not only the authoritarian French regime, but also the Western Reichspakt seeks to crush the syndicalist states. Thus, Monatte’s renewed vision is to build a true syndicalist nation for all the oppressed peoples of the world. Reactionaries still lurk everywhere, seeking to destroy the workers and Monatte himself, but he knows the struggle for workers’ rights cannot and must not fail. The Paris Commune may have perished, but it has lived on forever in the hearts of the people — and the cry of ‘Vive la Commune!’ shall now echo across all of Europe!\n\n‘The bourgeois covet wealth and steal the bread of the starving worker.\nThose who died for our great cause\nDid not die in vain!\nFor humankind writhing in shame needs but a single banner:\nLabor, justice, and the brotherhood of workers across all nations.’"

For Charles de Gaulle, the answer had always been the same: liberty, equality, fraternity.\n\nIn the wake of defeat in the Great War, tragedy struck swiftly. The collapse of the Republic, the rise of Jacques Doriot, and Doriot’s eventual failure all instilled in de Gaulle a deep anger toward the so-called ‘mass socialism,’ ‘fascism,’ and, above all, the ‘parliamentarianism’ that had failed to prevent any of it.\n\nThe fierce rivalry between Doriot and Déat spiraled into an uncontrollable political deadlock, plunging France into a deep pit of despair in the absence of a true leader. It was then, emerging from the fog, that a giant revealed himself. Declaring himself the ‘Sword of Salvation,’ Charles de Gaulle denounced radical figures like Doriot and Déat for selling away the soul of France, proclaiming that he alone could end this rotting age. Nationalism of order and a doctrine of leadership, he argued, would be the last bulwark to save France. Alongside this would stand strong executive power, a decisive leader, and the steel boots needed to draw Europe’s wayward ‘friends’ back to France’s side.\n\nHe needs no blind ideology. He needs no feeble parliamentarianism. All he requires is the glory and future of France."

Born of Jewish heritage, he came to deeply empathize with the hardships faced by Jews and ordinary workers through the Dreyfus Affair, and this life experience later allowed him to exercise immense influence within the party after the assassination of Jaurès. Blum drew great attention—both favorable and unfavorable—for his highlighting of the social issues faced by minorities in society.\n\nThe total collapse of Doriot brought Blum and the SFIO supporters into the presidential office. Blum will turn France into a new wave of roses through policies that understand and soothe the discontent and suffering of workers. Algerians who cause trouble must also be granted citizenship. Women, too, who have been excluded from social participation, must be brought into the front lines of society. Wage increases are self-evident. And the problems caused by the self-proclaimed 'liberals' of the Democratic Republican Alliance, who shout against all these recognitions, must also be resolved. To build a France where all citizens fully enjoy opportunity and fundamental rights, a France where every citizen has the chance to prosper and the ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity are truly realized.\nYet beyond the borders lies the Weltreich. Can Blum’s dream truly be fulfilled while such an empire exists? If they will not yield but instead threaten...\n...must we not seize what they deny us?"
 FRA_paul_reynaud_desc:0 ""It’s done. We have won." These words, spoken by Paul Reynaud as he entered the presidential office, are remembered as his hallmark. As can be seen, the Republic’s new president Paul Reynaud is, in the best sense, steadfast, and in the worst sense, stubborn. Reynaud won great resonance and support from the French people by opposing indemnities to Germany and calling for punitive measures against it. When the downfall of Jacques Doriot became certain, Reynaud abandoned him alongside Blum, and in the end surpassed Blum to become France’s leader.\n\nThough often called a liberal, Reynaud is also an intense anti-German, so radical that he has argued that Soviet Russia should be made into a security ally for the sake of a strong anti-German policy. His fierce defense of pro-market rhetoric, standing in direct opposition to workers’ rights and demands for basic liberties, drew controversy, but won him fervent support from entrepreneurs and liberals driven into crisis by Doriot. Blum calls him a friend of business; businessmen think of him as their lapdog. Reynaud can respond: both of you, shut up! Reynaud loves a lively market operating without interference, and just as he abandoned Blum, he would abandon the businessmen if they obstruct it. Of course, if they use the free market ‘properly’, Reynaud will embrace them. But should they ‘corrupt’ it, then the businessmen will meet a dreadful fate—so dreadful that Pierre Monatte will appear as a moderate liberal by comparison—and will have to yield their place to a new generation of entrepreneurs. As a leader, Reynaud’s foremost priority is to make France function through perfect parliamentary politics and the ‘invisible hand’, to become strong and prosperous, and to thrust a dagger into the very heart of the German menace to safeguard France’s freedom and sovereignty."
