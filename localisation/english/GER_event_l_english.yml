 Germany.43.t:0 "German-Ottoman Alliance"

 Germany.62.t:0 "Resistance of Boers"
 Germany.62.d:0 "Last night, the Boers rioted on a large-scale basis. Eleven government offices have been burned and 30 people have been confirmed dead.

 Germany.90.d:0 "Albert Einestein\nClayallee 150 14195 Berlin\n\nWilhelm II\nSchloßplatz 1 10178 Berlin\n\nYour Majesty:\n Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations: In the course of the last four months it has been made probable—through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in Austria-Hungary-Croatia—that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future. This phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable—though much less certain—that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air."
 Germany.90.a:0 "Next."
 Germany.91.t:0 "Second Page"
 Germany.91.d:0 "Mainland of Germany has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and Bohemia, while the most important source of uranium is German Congo. In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in Germany. One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial capacity. His task might comprise the following:\na)  to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for mainland of Germany.\nb)  to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary equipment.\nI know that France has asked their ally Britain to ban the sale of uranium from its uranium mines in Tannada to other countries except France. France has moved so quickly, perhaps because people like André Dewavrin of French Bureau central de renseignements et d'action have reported that Germany is doing something with uranium.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAlbert Einstein"

Once Germany's biggest victory anniversary was Sedantag, but now it has given way to Siegtag.\n\nFrom Maas to Memel, from Etsch to Belt, veterans and soldiers march through the streets to the sound of the magnificent military band's military songs, receiving cheers.
