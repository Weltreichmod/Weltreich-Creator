 Germany.1.t:0 "The Marx Scandal"
 Germany.1.d:0 "A tip-off came in just as the sun was setting on the horizon. Chancellor Wilhelm Marx's political and economic collusion was enough to catch the attention of the editorial department who worked all night long at dawn, and finally stopped the rotating machine. The news that flew out of the arc this morning is shocking. The targets of political and economic collusion are Jews and their associated capitalists who many in Germany hate. The army's supreme command, which originally disliked the chancellor, fiercely opposed it and poured out criticism at a press conference. Even hours had passed, the government's explanation flew in, but it seems that it was not enough to calm public opinion.\n\nPolitical and economic collusion is common in imperial politics, but Wilhelm's case is a problem. If the anonymous tip is true, a significant amount of money transactions have been confirmed, which will cause a devastating loss of trust in Her Majesty's Cabinet. What do the parties have in mind about the Prime Minister's mouth and the growing aftermath?"
 Germany.1.a:0 "Bloody hell, I never took it!"
 Germany.2.t:0 "Carry Out a Cabinet Reshuffle in Germany"
 Germany.2.d:0 "The German Kaiser has made a decision. Earlier today, the German government announced the resignation of Chancellor Wilhelm Marx from the cabinet and sent out expert opinions on this. There are rumors that the related scandal has emerged as a major internal and external agenda less than a week ago, and that he submitted his resignation without being able to withstand public opinion, or that there is great pressure from the large military, but what is certain is that he has lost all power.\n\nOf course, everything is not clear: which Jewish capitalists were fixated with Wilhelm, if the men in the military who were envious of him told it to Kaiser, even the existence of the links. But whatever, he stepped down and the spotlight was on Germany."

 Germany.43.t:0 "German-Ottoman Alliance"
 Germany.43.d:0 "Yesterday lunch, Germany and Ottoman agreed to the German-Ottoman Mutual Defense Treaty. As if during the Great War, the two countries became allies.

 Germany.53.t:0 "Finland's rejection"

 Germany.62.t:0 "Resistance of Boers"
 Germany.62.d:0 "Last night, the Boers rioted on a large-scale basis. Eleven government offices have been burned and 30 people have been confirmed dead.

 Germany.90.d:0 "Albert Einestein\nClayallee 150 14195 Berlin\n\nWilhelm II\nSchloßplatz 1 10178 Berlin\n\nYour Majesty:\n Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations: In the course of the last four months it has been made probable—through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in Austria-Hungary-Croatia—that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future. This phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable—though much less certain—that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air."
 Germany.90.a:0 "Next."
 Germany.91.t:0 "Second Page"
 Germany.91.d:0 "Mainland of Germany has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and Bohemia, while the most important source of uranium is German Congo. In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in Germany. One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial capacity. His task might comprise the following:\na)  to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for mainland of Germany.\nb)  to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary equipment.\nI know that France has asked their ally Britain to ban the sale of uranium from its uranium mines in Tannada to other countries except France. France has moved so quickly, perhaps because people like André Dewavrin of French Bureau central de renseignements et d'action have reported that Germany is doing something with uranium.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAlbert Einstein"

 Germany.1000.t:0 "Weltkrieg Siegtag"
 Germany.1000.d:0 "Since the end of the Great War on November 11th, 1919, January 18th, the day France surrendered to Germany, has been designated as the anniversary of the victory of the Great War. Once Germany's biggest victory anniversary was Sedantag, but now it has given way to Siegtag.\n\nFrom Maas to Memel, from Etsch to Belt, veterans and soldiers march through the streets to the sound of the magnificent military band's military songs, receiving cheers. The whole empire is decorated by black white and red flag.  And the citizens, they're celebrating their victory in the war."
 Germany.1000.a:0 "For Kaiser, For Vaterland!"
