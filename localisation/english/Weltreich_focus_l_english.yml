Our audacious plan to motorize the entire army will enable enhanced troop mobility, flexibility, and rapid penetration (or breakthrough). Furthermore, we will develop and actively utilize mechanized equipment to maximize the destructive power of our infantry. While we could certainly build massive and powerful heavy tanks, such vehicles are too few in number and do not align with our doctrine.

Fearing these French artillery corps, the Germans attempted to emasculate the French artillery tradition through various treaties, specifically by halving the number of field guns the French Army could possess and disbanding our seasoned gunnery units. However, the Germans could take our cannons, but they could not take the soul of the French artillery. The creators of scientific gunnery, the French artillerymen, refused to be broken. Our artillery, which first understood ballistics, mastered the technique of adjusting elevation and muzzle velocity to achieve Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact. Even with the reduced number of gun barrels, we maintained the same projected firepower. Furthermore, by assigning a motorized vehicle to every single gun, we maximized our mobility.

Therefore, we will forge a steel behemoth capable of executing this task with relative security while simultaneously sowing terror among the enemy. We will convert existing medium and heavy tank chassis into self-propelled guns and tank destroyers, designed to shatter enemy defenses and eliminate their armored vehicles. When needed, they will spearhead assaults alongside the infantry. However, this is insufficient. We will introduce the Flamethrower Tank, a vehicle armed with the most fearsome weapon of all. This harbinger of dread will be mounted with a high-capacity, vehicle-grade flamethrower, enduring heavy fire to unleash an inferno upon the enemy.

By integrating surface vessels, submarines, and air assets into a unified doctrine, we will ensure that our adversaries are unable to secure supply routes or maintain logistical operations at sea. This approach goes beyond simple naval engagements—it is a comprehensive strategy to blockade the seas on a strategic level and erode the enemy's capacity to sustain war. In line with the principles of the Jeune École, we reject the pursuit of traditional capital ship superiority and instead focus on constraining enemy naval mobility and commerce through a doctrine of sea denial.

To eradicate this threat at its root, Bucard has ordered the deployment of French 'Supervisors' across all administrative, economic, and social sectors of Germany, establishing a total system of surveillance and control.\n\nThese Supervisors will stand above all local law, enforcing strict discipline and punishing even the slightest defiance.

Schools teach obedience and repentance, while the press has become a mere instrument to glorify France.\n\nThis system is presented as a 'social reformation experiment'—a means to correct the German spirit.

Amid this chaos, Yan Huiqing—an elder statesman long regarded as competent yet politically reserved—reluctantly stepped forward to assume provisional leadership.\n\nYan's government does not seek grandeur or ideological crusades. Its purpose lies in stabilizing the fractured machinery of administration and guiding China back toward legality. The most arbitrary and destructive elements of Cao Kun's 'Great Reform' are struck from the record, while those reforms capable of serving the national good are placed back within the framework of constitutional governance. Under Yan's cautious stewardship, the Republic attempts to regain its footing, neither surrendering to warlord despotism nor collapsing into populist fury.\n\nThis provisional administration is not meant to endure forever. Its mission is to preserve order, prepare the ground for a national election, and ensure that the Republic does not once again drift into chaos.

Orders issued under warlord pressure, directives lacking clear legal authority, and records bearing signs of corruption are being identified and discarded, while only those documents verified through lawful procedures are retained as the basis of national governance. The leadership has concluded that the restoration of the Republic must begin with the restoration of administrative order.\n\nThis process is more than a clerical cleanup; it is an essential step toward rebuilding the functional capacity of the state.

To eradicate illegal conscription and private armies that have persisted since the warlord era, a new Military Inspection Office has been formed to investigate and supervise all military units. The logistics system is being reorganized under new regulations, and the national defense budget is now strictly supervised to prevent corruption and misuse of military funds.\n\nThis focus represents not merely military reform, but an essential step toward unifying the Republic's fragmented armed forces and restoring national security.

In the years that followed, political instability, Zhang Xueliang's unauthorized expedition, and the collapse of order in the Northeast made comprehensive reform of the conscription system unavoidable.\n\nThe Provisional Government of Yan Huiqing now seeks to reintroduce the amendment to establish transparency in conscription administration, abolish the institutional foundations of militias and private armies, and restore firm central control over the national military. The new draft includes provisions specifically designed to prevent unauthorized mobilizations like the recent Northern Expedition and aims to end the warlord practice of raising private forces.\n\nIf the amendment passes, the Republic will regain a legal framework capable of unifying its fractured military structure. However, warlord-aligned legislators and regional representatives strongly oppose the proposal, fearing the loss of their local military power. The provisional government must overcome this resistance. Reforming the conscription law is the essential first step toward restoring stability to the Republic."

 CHI_partial_acceptance_cao_kun_reform_desc:0 "During the final phase of Cao Kun's administration, he launched a sweeping political overhaul—later known as the 'Cao Kun Reform'—in an attempt to overcome parliamentary resistance and consolidate his own power. This reform package introduced the direct presidential election, a massive redistricting of constituencies, expansion of legislative seats, and extensive administrative restructuring, fundamentally reshaping the political order of the Republic.\n\nHowever, these changes lacked procedural legitimacy and provoked strong opposition from warlord factions, political parties, and the intellectual community, ultimately contributing to the collapse of Cao Kun's regime. The Provisional Government of Yan Huiqing now seeks to avoid further instability by selectively accepting only practical components of the reform rather than abolishing it entirely.\n\nThough this decision may bring short-term political costs, it represents a necessary transitional measure to gradually restore constitutional stability to the Republic."

As a result, we have decided to reorganize and implement the entirety of the reform as a comprehensive package.\n\nThis decision will help diminish the regional power held by warlord factions and restructure both electoral and administrative systems under the standards of the central government. Although short-term instability and political cost will inevitably follow, this measure is essential for the long-term stability and institutional coherence of the Republic."
 CHI_abandon_northeastern_army:0 "Abandon the Northeastern Army"
 CHI_abandon_northeastern_army_desc:0 "After Zhang Xueliang's unauthorized expedition and the disastrous defeat near Liaoyang, the Northeastern Army has lost any semblance of a coherent fighting force. A large portion of its troops were killed or dispersed, and the remnants have turned to desertion and looting, forfeiting the trust of the people. With Zhang himself having abandoned the front and wasting away in a hotel in Yingkou, there is no longer any meaning in maintaining the Northeastern Army as a main pillar of the Republic.\n\nThe Provisional Government of Yan Huiqing has therefore chosen to face reality and officially abandon the attempt to preserve the Northeastern Army as an independent power. All operational plans under the banner of a Northern Expedition are to be canceled, and surviving soldiers will either be integrated into the regular army structure or demobilized and returned to civilian life. The Northeastern Marshal's Office will be reorganized under central supervision, and no further unilateral military actions in the name of the Northeast will be tolerated.\n\nThis focus represents a decisive break with a failed legacy. By relinquishing the ambition tied to the Northeastern Army, the Republic can redirect its military policy toward realistic defense and internal stability. Rather than chasing lost dreams, we must now commit ourselves to protecting the territory and people we still hold."

All private militias and irregular armed groups will be legally disbanded, and their personnel, equipment, and command structures will be reorganized under the unified authority of the central government.

Continuing to rely on an ideology so closely claimed by our political adversary risks blurring our legitimacy and weakening our ability to establish an independent national course.\n\nRecognizing both the historical relevance of the Three Principles and the political limitations imposed by the present conflict, the new government has initiated a comprehensive review of its ideological foundation. The alternative now under consideration is the 'Three Principles of the Agape,' which articulate three core values: love for the people, love for the nation, and love for the shared future. Unlike traditional doctrinal slogans, this framework aims to present a more inclusive and morally grounded foundation for national unity.\n\nThe Three Principles of the Agape do not belong to any single party or faction. Rather, they are envisioned as a unifying doctrine capable of guiding a fractured society toward reconciliation, reconstruction, and long-term stability. Once formally adopted, they will serve as the principal ideological compass for China's renewed path forward."

'Governing for the People' represents the Constitutional Protection Government's comprehensive effort to restore state capacity, stabilize the lives of its citizens, and lay the long-term administrative and economic foundations required for national recovery.\n\nDuring the conflict, both central and local administrations weakened severely, fiscal structures collapsed, and essential services such as policing, transportation, and public welfare ceased functioning in many regions. Without repairing this structural damage, China cannot hope to rebuild itself. The government therefore prioritizes administrative reorganization, fiscal reforms, the restart of key industries, and the restoration of critical infrastructure.\n\nThe Governing for the People focus is not merely a response to crisis; it is the groundwork for restoring China's ability to function as a unified state. To govern effectively and uplift the people—this is the core philosophy that the new administration seeks to embody."

Many towns and cities remain without functioning public services, and vast numbers of citizens still rely on government assistance for basic survival.\n\nThe Love the People focus commits the state to stabilizing relief systems, restoring administrative capacity, supporting livelihoods, resettling displaced families, and rebuilding essential medical and sanitary infrastructures.

The extensive censorship and wartime controls imposed during the civil war now stand in the way of national recovery, and dismantling these measures has become a central mission of the Constitutional Protection Government.\n\n'Love Freedom' does not advocate unrestrained liberty; rather, it affirms the responsibility of the state to guarantee the minimum conditions under which citizens can act as engaged and accountable members of the republic.

It called for disciplined administration and equitable development during national reconstruction, ensuring that no faction or interest group dominates the rebuilding process.\n\nThe principle served as a practical guide for restoring the country's foundations: rehabilitation of the land, responsible management of public resources, fair allocation of social assets, and the reestablishment of administrative order. In a period marked by disrupted local governance and the fragmentation of military and civilian authority, 'Love All Things' provided an important conceptual basis for defining the proper standards of national governance."
