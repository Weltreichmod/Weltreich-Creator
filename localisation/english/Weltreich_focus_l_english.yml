However, the Germans could take our cannons, but they could not take the soul of the French artillery. The creators of scientific gunnery, the French artillerymen, refused to be broken. Our artillery, which first understood ballistics, mastered the technique of adjusting elevation and muzzle velocity to achieve Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact. Even with the reduced number of gun barrels, we maintained the same projected firepower. Furthermore, by assigning a motorized vehicle to every single gun, we maximized our mobility.  As the Germans themselves once said, That which does not kill France only makes her stronger."

 FRA_Support_Role_of_Armor_desc:0 "Even heavily armed combat engineers risk annihilation when assaulting enemy defensive lines. Therefore, we will forge a steel behemoth capable of executing this task with relative security while simultaneously sowing terror among the enemy. We will convert existing medium and heavy tank chassis into self-propelled guns and tank destroyers, designed to shatter enemy defenses and eliminate their armored vehicles. When needed, they will spearhead assaults alongside the infantry. However, this is insufficient. We will introduce the Flamethrower Tank, a vehicle armed with the most fearsome weapon of all. This harbinger of dread will be mounted with a high-capacity, vehicle-grade flamethrower, enduring heavy fire to unleash an inferno upon the enemy. This terrifying Demolition Tank will serve as a symbol of courage for our forces and an incarnation of fear for the adversary."

 FRA_denial_of_the_sea_desc:0 "We do not need to dominate the seas. What matters is denying the enemy the freedom to use them. By integrating surface vessels, submarines, and air assets into a unified doctrine, we will ensure that our adversaries are unable to secure supply routes or maintain logistical operations at sea. This approach goes beyond simple naval engagements—it is a comprehensive strategy to blockade the seas on a strategic level and erode the enemy's capacity to sustain war. In line with the principles of the Jeune École, we reject the pursuit of traditional capital ship superiority and instead focus on constraining enemy naval mobility and commerce through a doctrine of sea denial. This strategy represents the most realistic and effective path to achieving maritime superiority with limited resources."
 FRA_submarine_wolfpack_tactics:0 "Submarine Wolfpack Tactics"
 FRA_submarine_wolfpack_tactics_desc:0 "The isolated ambushes of individual submarines are no longer sufficient to cripple large-scale enemy logistics. We will integrate our submarine fleet into a unified tactical system built around coordinated, massed attacks—'wolfpack tactics.'

This doctrine embodies the very essence of asymmetric naval warfare envisioned by the Jeune École."
 FRA_escort_flotilla_doctrine:0 "Establish Escort Flotilla Doctrine"
 FRA_escort_flotilla_doctrine_desc:0 "The Jeune École challenges traditional capital ship doctrines by advocating tactics where numerous small and agile naval units overwhelm the enemy. Escort ships, in particular, are strategic assets capable of performing a wide range of missions—from coastal defense and convoy escort to reconnaissance and torpedo attacks. We will establish a formal doctrine centered around these light vessels, institutionalizing tactics that rely on continuous harassment and swarm-based disruption of enemy naval power. This doctrine enables us to undermine enemy maritime operations effectively, even with limited resources."

After the Great Depression, Germany found itself isolated within the very world order it had forged, and the shadow of defeat still lingers in the national memory.\n\nOnce proclaiming itself the height of civilization, the Empire has descended into a symbol of barbarism and cruelty. Germany, refusing to face its own past, seeks once more to rule through power and fear. But the world now knows the truth of the Reich’s nature.

By binding this region—geographically adjacent to northern France—into closer administrative and economic ties, France aims to establish a strategic buffer and secure access to major ports and trade routes. Establishing common customs, infrastructure projects, and defense arrangements would promote reconstruction and prosperity across the region while curbing the expansion of German and other great-power influence. This unification is intended as a measured process—focused on gradual administrative integration, economic cooperation, and guarantees of regional autonomy—rather than a forcible annexation, with the goal of creating a durable and legitimate order."

The German people remain vulnerable to the ghosts of their former Empire and the temptations of militarism—dangers that could once again set Europe aflame. To eradicate this threat at its root, Bucard has ordered the deployment of French ‘Supervisors’ across all administrative, economic, and social sectors of Germany, establishing a total system of surveillance and control.\n\nThese Supervisors will stand above all local law, enforcing strict discipline and punishing even the slightest defiance. Germany shall lose all sovereignty and autonomy, becoming an administrative apparatus that operates solely under French command. Though this measure will surely provoke outrage from the international community, every sacrifice will be justified in the name of France’s eternal security and its rightful dominion over Europe."

Barbed wire seals the borders, surveillance posts rise in every city, and every individual’s movement and thought are strictly monitored. Schools teach obedience and repentance, while the press has become a mere instrument to glorify France.\n\nThis system is presented as a 'social reformation experiment'—a means to correct the German spirit.

Each region is divided into sectors under meticulous surveillance, and the press is censored under the pretext of ‘restoring peace.’\n\nIndustry has been reorganized according to the economic plans of metropolitan France, while local workers are integrated into a strictly controlled framework of ‘reconstruction.’ Schools have adopted mandatory French education, and history textbooks now glorify France’s civilizing mission. Traces of resistance are gradually fading, and the new generation learns obedience as a natural virtue.\n\nFrance now governs through a trinity of bayonets, bureaucracy, and propaganda. Visible violence may have diminished, yet invisible control has become ever more precise.

Dutch and Flemish signs are vanishing one by one, as the French language becomes the medium of public life.\n\nThrough education, media, and cultural policy, the French government is instilling a French national identity among the peoples of the Low Countries. Schools teach French history and literature, newspapers and radio broadcasts are transmitted through Parisian networks, and local officials follow French administrative protocols. A new generation is being raised not as Belgians or Dutchmen, but as French citizens.\n\nThis policy is not a mere act of cultural assimilation—it is a long-term strategy to consolidate France’s European order.

German science is now the property of France.\n\nThe French government calls this the ‘rightful restoration of European civilization,’ integrating German researchers into France’s industrial and military projects by force. Achievements in electronics, aerodynamics, chemistry, and weapon design are reborn under French names. German scientists have lost the right to publish in their own language, and every invention born from their hands is now claimed under the French flag.\n\nFrance’s laboratories are now filled with the knowledge taken from Germany.
