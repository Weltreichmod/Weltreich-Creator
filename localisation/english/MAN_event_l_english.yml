 manchukou.1.t:0 "Chun Jie Offensive"
 manchukou.1.d:0 "It has been barely a month since the bandit forces crossed from the Republic and violated the territory of Manchukuo in the 12th month of the 19th Year of Datong. Yet their campaign, launched without legitimacy, has already faltered after suffering severe losses in the Battle of Anshan and falling back in disarray. The situation now presents us with a decisive opportunity. Should we fail to act, the task of eradicating these bandits will become immeasurably more difficult.\n\nThus, the commanders of Manchukuo have resolved to launch the Chun Jie Offensive. In accordance with the operational plan, we will exert pressure along the entire front against the so-called Northeast Army."
