 manchukou.1.t:0 "Chun Jie Offensive"
 manchukou.1.d:0 "It has been barely a month since the bandit forces crossed from the Republic and violated the territory of Manchukuo in the 12th month of the 19th Year of Datong. Yet their campaign, launched without legitimacy, has already faltered after suffering severe losses in the Battle of Anshan and falling back in disarray. The situation now presents us with a decisive opportunity. Should we fail to act, the task of eradicating these bandits will become immeasurably more difficult.\n\nThus, the commanders of Manchukuo have resolved to launch the Chun Jie Offensive. In accordance with the operational plan, we will exert pressure along the entire front against the so-called Northeast Army."
 manchukou.1.a:0 "Advance!"
 manchukou.2.t:0 "Intervention in the Mongolian Situation"
 manchukou.2.d:0 "Following the Soviet advance into Mongolia, the situation along the northern frontier has rapidly destabilized. The Manchukuo–Mongolia government and its military leadership have concluded that the crisis is not a mere border incident, but a direct threat to the security of both Manchuria and Mongolia.\n\nAccording to field reports, Soviet troops under General Blyukher's unauthorized command continue to push across the northern border, placing severe pressure on local settlements and administrative outposts.\n\nThe Imperial Council has convened an emergency session and decided that the situation can no longer be tolerated. Border Defense Forces and mobile cavalry divisions have been readied for deployment into the Mongolian front, with the government declaring the intervention as a measure to safeguard 'frontier stability and the order of the northern territories.'\n\nThis decision marks a new phase in the regional balance, and neighboring states are watching the development with great attention."
