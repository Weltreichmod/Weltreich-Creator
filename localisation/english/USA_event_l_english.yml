 usa.6.t:0 "Supreme Court's Constitutional Judgment on Social Security Act"
 usa.6.d:0 "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the Social Security Act as constitutional.

 usa.12.a:0 "Let's start it."
 usa.13.t:0 "Discussion on WPA"
 usa.13.d:0 "There was a discussion in Parliament about the upkeep of the WPA. In the midst of another recession, it is clear that ongoing public works will adversely affect the national debt. Therefore, we need to seriously think about reducing or abolishing this organization."

 usa.13.b:0 "Curtail it."
 usa.14.t:0 "Discussion on Social Security Act"

They argued that the 1937 panic clearly illustrated the limits of the New Deal, and the Republican majority in Congress reduced or abolished various New Deal laws and projects. Experts say that the period, called the Abolition of 100 days, is the starting point for a new Republican-style economic policy."
