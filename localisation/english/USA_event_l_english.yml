 usa.12.d:0 "Recession Of 1937 clearly illustrated the limits of the New Deal policy. Now we should leave this issue to the free market rather than modified capitalism.

 usa.12.a:0 "Let's start it."
 usa.13.t:0 "Discussion on WPA"
 usa.13.d:0 "There was a discussion in Parliament about the upkeep of the WPA. In the midst of another recession, it is clear that ongoing public works will adversely affect the national debt. Therefore, we need to seriously think about reducing or abolishing this organization."

They argued that the 1937 panic clearly illustrated the limits of the New Deal, and the Republican majority in Congress reduced or abolished various New Deal laws and projects. Experts say that the period, called the Abolition of 100 days, is the starting point for a new Republican-style economic policy."

The government has now officially announced its withdrawal from the French-led alliance, declaring its intent to restore the autonomy of American foreign policy.\n\nAlthough this decision is expected to cool relations with Paris, it also serves as a symbolic affirmation that the United States acts according to its own judgment and values.

This decision marks the establishment of an independent American foreign policy and reflects the nation’s will to pursue a new balance in international affairs, free from Europe’s struggles for dominance.\n\nAlthough Berlin has expressed deep regret, the United States has justified its action in the name of freedom and self-determination. America now stands apart from every alliance, positioning itself as an independent great power on the world stage."
