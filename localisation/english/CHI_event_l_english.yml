 china_wr.1.t:0 "Reintroduction of the Conscription Law Amendment"
 china_wr.1.d:0 "Near the end of Cao Kun’s administration, the National Assembly attempted to pass an amendment to the conscription law in order to suppress the warlord militia system and centralize military authority. However, Cao Kun vetoed the proposal, preventing even proper discussion. As a result, the bill was discarded entirely. Soon after, the nation fell into rapid political turmoil, and Zhang Xueliang’s unauthorized Northern Expedition, combined with the worsening Northeastern crisis, made fundamental reform of the conscription system unavoidable.\n\nThe Provisional Government of Yan Huiqing is now pushing once again to revise the conscription law to stabilize military command and dismantle the remaining warlord power structures. The new amendment includes not only the previously debated issues—such as transparent conscription procedures, the legal status of militias, and centralization of force organization—but also new provisions designed to prevent further unauthorized troop mobilizations as seen recently.\n\nIf the amendment passes, the Republic will finally be able to restore a military system firmly under central control. However, warlord-aligned legislators and numerous regional representatives strongly oppose the reform, fearing that their local power bases will be weakened. The provisional government cannot avoid confronting this challenge; it must resolve the matter decisively."
 china_wr.1.a:0 "One step at a time."
 china_wr.2.t_desc:0 "Partial Acceptance of the Cao Kun Reform"
 china_wr.2.d_desc:0 "The so-called ‘Cao Kun Reform,’ imposed unilaterally by Cao Kun, introduced direct presidential elections, extensive redistricting, and a greatly expanded legislature, leaving the political order of the Republic deeply destabilized. After the collapse of his regime, the reform remained unresolved and continued to fuel factional conflict.\n\nThe Provisional Government of Yan Huiqing now chooses to selectively accept only the essential components of the reform, rather than abolishing it entirely. This approach aims to reclaim administrative authority from the warlords and to restore coherence in the Republic’s electoral and administrative institutions.\n\nAlthough this measure brings short-term political cost, it is a necessary step toward restoring stability to the Republic."
 china_wr.2.a_desc:0 "The state must move forward with stability."
 china_wr.3.t:0 "Full Acceptance of the Cao Kun Reform"
 china_wr.3.d:0 "The Provisional Government of Yan Huiqing has determined that the partial acceptance of the Cao Kun Reform is insufficient to restore the full constitutional order of the Republic. After reviewing the entire structure of the reform, the government has decided to reintroduce its core components as a comprehensive system.\n\nThis measure stabilizes the central government's authority by reorganizing the direct presidential election system, redistricting laws, and the expanded legislature under unified standards. It will also weaken the entrenched regional power of the warlord factions. Nevertheless, the decision is expected to trigger political friction and temporary social instability.\n\nEven so, this 'full acceptance' is a necessary hardship for the Republic to regain institutional coherence and move forward."
 china_wr.3.a:0 "A necessary decision."
 china_wr.4.t:0 "Opening Negotiations with Japan"
 china_wr.4.d:0 "The unauthorized advance of the Northeastern Army and their looting near the Japanese concession in the Kwantung region has provoked strong Japanese protests. The Yan Huiqing Provisional Government fears that further escalation may invite military pressure from Japan.\n\nTo defuse the situation, an official envoy has been dispatched to Japan. The envoy conveyed the government's regret, clarifying that the Northeastern Army acted independently. To conclude the incident swiftly, the government has proposed a temporary transfer of Southern railway construction rights.\n\nThis concession may be humiliating, but it may be necessary to avert immediate disaster."
 china_wr.4.a:0 "Deliver the proposal to Japan."
 china_wr.5.t:0 "China’s Explanation and Concession Proposal"
 china_wr.5.d:0 "A Chinese delegation has delivered an official statement clarifying that the recent looting and unauthorized advance of the Northeastern Army near the Kwantung concession were entirely independent actions, carried out without the approval or knowledge of the central government. The delegation expressed deep regret for the disturbance and formally apologized for the incident.\n\nTo resolve the situation swiftly and ease tensions between both nations, China has proposed a temporary transfer of Southern railway construction rights to Japan. This concession appears intended to both compensate for the incident and stabilize diplomatic relations.\n\nThe Japanese government must now decide whether to accept this explanation and proposal."
 china_wr.5.a:0 "Accept China’s explanation and review the offer."
 china_wr.5.b:0 "Their explanation is insufficient. Stronger measures are required."
 china_wr.6.t:0 "Japan Accepts the Agreement"
 china_wr.6.d:0 "The Japanese government has accepted our explanation and apology, and has agreed to the temporary transfer of Southern railway construction rights. With Japan easing its diplomatic pressure, the immediate crisis appears to have subsided.\n\nThe Yan Huiqing Provisional Government argues that this was an unavoidable measure to prevent a larger conflict. However, domestic criticism is slowly emerging, accusing the government of making a humiliating compromise. Even so, the conclusion of these negotiations has undoubtedly bought the government some much-needed time."
 china_wr.6.a:0 "For now, the crisis has passed."
 china_wr.7.t:0 "Japan Rejects the Proposal"
 china_wr.7.d:0 "The Japanese government has rejected our explanation, refusal to accept our apology, and dismissed the proposed temporary transfer of Southern railway construction rights. Japan contends that the Northeastern Army’s unauthorized actions demonstrate the Chinese government's inability to maintain control.\n\nRecognizing the severity of the situation, the Yan Huiqing Provisional Government has begun preparing emergency countermeasures. While both the public and the National Assembly condemn Japan’s stance, there is growing fear that Japan may escalate pressure or even take military action.\n\nThe political climate is once again descending into uncertainty."

 china_wr.9.t:0 "Official Report on the Sichuan Situation"
 china_wr.9.d:0 "Mr. Acting President,\n\nI respectfully submit the following summary of the reports received from Sichuan regarding recent agricultural conditions and local sentiment. Certain counties have observed a modest decline in this year's harvest, though local authorities emphasize that the matter remains localized and poses no significant risk to the province’s overall production capacity. While a temporary rise in grain prices has led to minor public concern, corrective measures have reportedly been implemented, and conditions are said to be stabilizing.\n\nThere was a minor incident along the Yangtze River during the transport of goods, attributed to a simple misunderstanding. Local security units intervened promptly, and the likelihood of further escalation is assessed to be low. Administrative and security functions throughout the province are reported to be operating normally, with no signs of broader instability.\n\nIn conclusion, the situation in Sichuan is deemed manageable at the provincial level, and there is no current indication that immediate intervention from the central government is required."
