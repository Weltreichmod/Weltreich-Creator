 china_wr.1.t:0 "Reintroduction of the Conscription Law Amendment"
 china_wr.1.d:0 "Near the end of Cao Kun’s administration, the National Assembly attempted to pass an amendment to the conscription law in order to suppress the warlord militia system and centralize military authority. However, Cao Kun vetoed the proposal, preventing even proper discussion. As a result, the bill was discarded entirely. Soon after, the nation fell into rapid political turmoil, and Zhang Xueliang’s unauthorized Northern Expedition, combined with the worsening Northeastern crisis, made fundamental reform of the conscription system unavoidable.\n\nThe Provisional Government of Yan Huiqing is now pushing once again to revise the conscription law to stabilize military command and dismantle the remaining warlord power structures. The new amendment includes not only the previously debated issues—such as transparent conscription procedures, the legal status of militias, and centralization of force organization—but also new provisions designed to prevent further unauthorized troop mobilizations as seen recently.\n\nIf the amendment passes, the Republic will finally be able to restore a military system firmly under central control. However, warlord-aligned legislators and numerous regional representatives strongly oppose the reform, fearing that their local power bases will be weakened. The provisional government cannot avoid confronting this challenge; it must resolve the matter decisively."

 china_wr.2.t_desc:0 "Partial Acceptance of the Cao Kun Reform"
 china_wr.2.d_desc:0 "The so-called ‘Cao Kun Reform,’ imposed unilaterally by Cao Kun, introduced direct presidential elections, extensive redistricting, and a greatly expanded legislature, leaving the political order of the Republic deeply destabilized. After the collapse of his regime, the reform remained unresolved and continued to fuel factional conflict.\n\nThe Provisional Government of Yan Huiqing now chooses to selectively accept only the essential components of the reform, rather than abolishing it entirely. This approach aims to reclaim administrative authority from the warlords and to restore coherence in the Republic’s electoral and administrative institutions.\n\nAlthough this measure brings short-term political cost, it is a necessary step toward restoring stability to the Republic."
 china_wr.2.a_desc:0 "The state must move forward with stability."
 china_wr.3.t:0 "Full Acceptance of the Cao Kun Reform"
 china_wr.3.d:0 "The Provisional Government of Yan Huiqing has determined that the partial acceptance of the Cao Kun Reform is insufficient to restore the full constitutional order of the Republic. After reviewing the entire structure of the reform, the government has decided to reintroduce its core components as a comprehensive system.\n\nThis measure stabilizes the central government's authority by reorganizing the direct presidential election system, redistricting laws, and the expanded legislature under unified standards. It will also weaken the entrenched regional power of the warlord factions. Nevertheless, the decision is expected to trigger political friction and temporary social instability.\n\nEven so, this 'full acceptance' is a necessary hardship for the Republic to regain institutional coherence and move forward."

 china_wr.4.d:0 "The unauthorized advance of the Northeastern Army and their looting near the Japanese concession in the Kwantung region has provoked strong Japanese protests. The Yan Huiqing Provisional Government fears that further escalation may invite military pressure from Japan.\n\nTo defuse the situation, an official envoy has been dispatched to Japan. The envoy conveyed the government's regret, clarifying that the Northeastern Army acted independently. To conclude the incident swiftly, the government has proposed a temporary transfer of Southern railway construction rights.\n\nThis concession may be humiliating, but it may be necessary to avert immediate disaster."

 china_wr.5.t:0 "China’s Explanation and Concession Proposal"
 china_wr.5.d:0 "A Chinese delegation has delivered an official statement clarifying that the recent looting and unauthorized advance of the Northeastern Army near the Kwantung concession were entirely independent actions, carried out without the approval or knowledge of the central government. The delegation expressed deep regret for the disturbance and formally apologized for the incident.\n\nTo resolve the situation swiftly and ease tensions between both nations, China has proposed a temporary transfer of Southern railway construction rights to Japan. This concession appears intended to both compensate for the incident and stabilize diplomatic relations.\n\nThe Japanese government must now decide whether to accept this explanation and proposal."

 china_wr.6.d:0 "The Japanese government has accepted our explanation and apology, and has agreed to the temporary transfer of Southern railway construction rights. With Japan easing its diplomatic pressure, the immediate crisis appears to have subsided.\n\nThe Yan Huiqing Provisional Government argues that this was an unavoidable measure to prevent a larger conflict. However, domestic criticism is slowly emerging, accusing the government of making a humiliating compromise. Even so, the conclusion of these negotiations has undoubtedly bought the government some much-needed time."

 china_wr.7.t:0 "Japan Rejects the Proposal"
 china_wr.7.d:0 "The Japanese government has rejected our explanation, refusal to accept our apology, and dismissed the proposed temporary transfer of Southern railway construction rights. Japan contends that the Northeastern Army’s unauthorized actions demonstrate the Chinese government's inability to maintain control.\n\nRecognizing the severity of the situation, the Yan Huiqing Provisional Government has begun preparing emergency countermeasures. While both the public and the National Assembly condemn Japan’s stance, there is growing fear that Japan may escalate pressure or even take military action.\n\nThe political climate is once again descending into uncertainty."

 china_wr.9.d:0 "Mr. Acting President,\n\nI respectfully submit the following summary of the reports received from Sichuan regarding recent agricultural conditions and local sentiment. Certain counties have observed a modest decline in this year's harvest, though local authorities emphasize that the matter remains localized and poses no significant risk to the province’s overall production capacity. While a temporary rise in grain prices has led to minor public concern, corrective measures have reportedly been implemented, and conditions are said to be stabilizing.\n\nThere was a minor incident along the Yangtze River during the transport of goods, attributed to a simple misunderstanding. Local security units intervened promptly, and the likelihood of further escalation is assessed to be low. Administrative and security functions throughout the province are reported to be operating normally, with no signs of broader instability.\n\nIn conclusion, the situation in Sichuan is deemed manageable at the provincial level, and there is no current indication that immediate intervention from the central government is required."
 china_wr.9.a:0 "Continue monitoring.
 china_wr.10.t:0 "Outbreak of the Sichuan Famine"
 china_wr.10.d:0 "Reports from Sichuan indicate that what began as localized crop failures and food shortages has now escalated into a full-scale famine. Some county-level documents already speak of widespread starvation and mass flight from the countryside, while rumors suggest that local officials may be underreporting the severity of the crisis for fear of censure from above.\n\nUntil now, the central government has attempted to manage the situation as a mere ‘threat of famine’, but it is no longer possible to treat it as a limited regional disaster. The Sichuan crisis has become more than a natural calamity; it is a grave test of the Republic’s administrative, logistical, and security capabilities. We must now formally acknowledge this as a national emergency and prepare for a prolonged campaign of relief and reconstruction."

 china_wr.11.t:0 "Famine Sweeps Through Sichuan"
 china_wr.11.d:0 "News has spread that an unprecedented famine is ravaging western China. In the rural and mountainous districts of Sichuan, harvests have collapsed, and weak transport and distribution networks have failed to deliver food to either towns or villages. Foreign correspondents report columns of refugees fleeing hunger, empty marketplaces, and villages haunted by rumors of starvation.\n\nThe Chinese central government has declared the crisis a ‘national disaster’ and announced emergency measures, yet there is growing doubt as to whether it has the finances and administrative capacity to follow through. The international community now watches closely to see whether China’s political system can withstand this humanitarian and political shock."
 china_wr.11.a:0 "Hunger recognizes no borders."
 china_wr.12.t:0 "Relief Reaches Sichuan"
 china_wr.12.d:0 "After long delays and countless obstacles, the first large-scale relief shipments have finally begun to reach Sichuan. Central convoys and military transport units have managed to bypass collapsed bridges and ruined roads, using river routes, improvised docks, and mountain passes to push supplies into several key hubs across the province.\n\nTemporary distribution points and clinics have been established in county seats, with food and medicine allocated first to the hardest-hit communities. Supplies remain far from sufficient to cover the entire region, but reports indicate that the number of people collapsing from hunger has begun to fall. The operation has not yet turned the tide of the famine, but it has shown that the disaster can, at least in part, be pushed back."
 china_wr.12.a:0 "At last, we can catch our breath—if only slightly."
 china_wr.13.t:0 "The Cancelled Early Election"
 china_wr.13.d:0 "Amid the Sichuan famine and nationwide unrest, the early presidential election that the government once promised has, in practice, been postponed indefinitely. Many regions have not even completed their voter registries; refugees, public disorder, and administrative paralysis have made it impossible to guarantee a fair and orderly vote.\n\nThe government presents this as an unavoidable administrative necessity, but neither the public nor the parties are inclined to accept that explanation at face value. Opposition leaders and newspapers accuse the authorities of using the crisis as a pretext to extend their grip on power, while ordinary citizens complain that they have lost not only their livelihoods but also their political voice. The cancellation of the early election adds a new layer of distrust atop the tragedy unfolding in Sichuan."
 china_wr.13.a:0 "In times of crisis, political trust is the first to crumble."
 china_wr.14.t:0 "Appeal to the Great Powers"
 china_wr.14.d:0 "As the Sichuan famine drags on, the central government has been forced to admit that it cannot manage the crisis alone. It has therefore dispatched formal appeals for aid to the major powers of the world, including detailed reports on the scale of the disaster, estimated casualties, and the urgent need for food, medicine, and technical assistance.\n\nSome argued that national pride and the principle of non-interference should prevent foreign involvement in China’s internal affairs. In the end, however, the prospect of saving millions of lives outweighed such concerns. The international community must now decide how to respond, balancing humanitarian ideals against strategic interests."
 china_wr.14.a:0 "We have no choice but to extend our hand for help."
 china_wr.15.t:0 "China’s Appeal Reaches [FROM.GetName]"
 china_wr.15.d:0 "The government of China has formally approached [ROOT.GetName], along with several other nations, requesting assistance in confronting the famine in Sichuan and other western regions. Their appeal asks for shipments of food and medicine, expert personnel, and even technical advice on how to move supplies safely into the interior.\n\nOur response will mean more than a few cargo ships or trainloads of grain. The decision taken by the [ROOT.GetAdjective] government will shape our future relationship with China, influence global opinion, and serve as a test of the civilizational and humanitarian values we claim to uphold."
 china_wr.15.a:0 "Approve the aid, in the name of humanity."

 china_wr.16.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Approves Relief"
 china_wr.16.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has agreed to our request for assistance in dealing with the Sichuan famine. They have officially pledged to send food, medical supplies, and personnel, and have offered to allocate part of their ports and transport capacity specifically for shipments bound for China.\n\nThis aid alone will not resolve the crisis, but rumors of ‘foreign grain’ have already begun to spread in warehouses and distribution centers. To ensure that this support is used as effectively as possible, the central government has decided to establish a special committee to oversee allocation and transport."
 china_wr.16.a:0 "We must remember this act of goodwill."
 china_wr.17.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses Relief"
 china_wr.17.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has politely but firmly refused our appeal for aid in the Sichuan famine. Citing domestic conditions, budgetary constraints, or diplomatic considerations, they have declared that they cannot participate directly in the relief effort.\n\nThe language of their diplomatic note is cautious and courteous, yet it offers us nothing tangible. Some officials mutter that our expectations were unrealistic from the start; others are angered by what they see as international indifference to China’s suffering."
 china_wr.17.a:0 "We will have to endure with what we have."
 china_wr.18.t:0 "Outcome of the Relief Effort"
 china_wr.18.desc.a:0 "We sent appeals for aid to many nations, laying bare the full extent of the famine in Sichuan. Yet the replies we received were cold and distant. Not a single country has committed to providing meaningful assistance; most limit themselves to expressions of ‘regret’ and careful diplomatic distancing.\n\nIn the end, no outside power will come to save Sichuan. With limited resources and a fragile logistical framework, the Republic must face this disaster largely unaided. The lesson is harsh but unmistakable: we cannot entrust the fate of the nation to the goodwill of others."
 china_wr.18.desc.b:0 "Only a handful of countries responded positively to our desperate appeals, but those that did have offered food, medicine, and personnel. Their contributions will help ease the worst suffering in the hardest-hit areas and may prevent the famine from descending into total catastrophe.\n\nEven so, vast stretches of Sichuan’s fields and mountain villages remain beyond the reach of any relief program. This international assistance is not a cure but a brace to keep a collapsing structure standing a little longer. We must use it wisely, while searching for longer-term solutions of our own."
 china_wr.18.desc.c:0 "Our appeals have borne fruit: nearly every nation we approached has agreed to assist. Shipments of grain and medicine are arriving in steadily increasing volumes, and foreign experts and volunteers are joining relief operations across Sichuan.\n\nNo amount of aid can bring back the lives already lost, but this unprecedented wave of support has prevented the famine from becoming a permanent, entrenched disaster. At the same time, it offers China a chance to rebuild its credibility as a responsible member of the international community."
 china_wr.18.a:0 "In the end, we can rely only on ourselves."
 china_wr.18.b:0 "At least we may have a chance to avoid the very worst."

 china_wr.19.t:0 "Promise of an Early Election"
 china_wr.19.d:0 "As distrust in the central government mounts amid the Sichuan famine and subsequent disturbances, Acting President Yan Huiqing has publicly pledged to hold an early general election as a means of restoring political stability. He has declared that, once the immediate emergency has eased, new presidential and parliamentary elections will be held regardless of the current terms of office.\n\nThis promise does not resolve the crisis overnight, but it has at least softened fears that the incumbent authorities intend to cling to power indefinitely. The people and the parties will now watch closely to see whether this pledge is merely a stalling tactic, or the first genuine step toward the restoration of constitutional order."
 china_wr.19.a:0 "Only by keeping our word can we hope to regain trust."
 china_wr.20.t:0 "The End of the Sichuan Famine"
 china_wr.20.d:0 "The great famine that has weighed upon the Republic for years has finally entered a phase of stabilization. The large-scale relief operations utilizing the Yangtze river network, the nationwide logistics mobilization order, and the limited but crucial international assistance have collectively taken effect. Even in the regions that suffered the worst starvation, organized reports of mass death are no longer being received.\n\nOf course, scars remain across Sichuan’s fields and mountain villages. Families torn apart, indebted households crushed by loans, and refugees who have yet to return home all stand as living reminders of this disaster’s long shadow. Even so, the central government now judges that the worst stage—‘mass starvation’—has been averted, and preparations must begin to transition from emergency relief to long-term recovery and reconstruction.\n\nThe Sichuan famine has revealed both the capabilities and limitations of the Republic. What remains is not simply to remember this tragedy as a natural disaster, but to treat it as a starting point for reforming our institutions, administration, and economic structures."
 china_wr.20.a:0 "Now begins the time for recovery—and accountability."
 china_wr.21.t:0 "The Acting President’s Choice"
 china_wr.21.d:0 "As the Sichuan famine enters a stable phase and preparations for the early presidential election accelerate, the political focus of the Republic has returned to the question of who shall become the next President. Acting President Yan Huiqing, who has guided the nation through recent turmoil, has decided to hold informal discussions with the major candidates who may shape the Republic’s future.\n\nThe Progressive Party raises the banner of ‘People’s Welfare and Equal Livelihood,’ arguing that the most urgent task is restoring the lives of the starving and impoverished masses. The Chinese Youth Party promotes ‘Constitutional Democracy,’ insisting that the Sichuan tragedy was the result of outdated political practices and disregard for constitutional norms. The Kuomintang advances ‘Northern Expedition and Reunification,’ warning that without resolving the Manchurian–Mongolian question and the unequal treaty ports, any reform would remain incomplete.\n\nYan Huiqing intends to speak individually with prominent figures from each party, directly examining their diagnoses of the Republic’s crisis and their proposed solutions. His reflections and choices will serve as a critical milestone in determining the landscape of the coming election."

 china_wr.22.d:0 "Acting President Yan Huiqing invited the Progressive Party’s presidential candidate to a private conference room for an in-depth discussion on the Republic’s direction after the Sichuan famine. The Progressive candidate began firmly: "Politics is livelihood," and spoke not of statistics or reports, but of the farmers and workers personally encountered in the famine-stricken regions.\n\nHe argued that the famine was not merely a natural disaster caused by several years of poor harvests, but the explosion of structural problems: unequal land systems, weak labor protections, apathetic local administrations, and the absence of any meaningful social welfare. He presented a detailed ‘People’s Welfare and Equal Livelihood’ policy package centered on farmers, workers, and small merchants, outlining tax reforms, financial restructuring, and long-term plans for balanced regional development.\n\nYan Huiqing questioned calmly whether such reforms would exceed the Republic’s administrative and fiscal capacity, or burden the national economy. But by the end of the meeting, he found one truth undeniable: unless the wounds of Sichuan were healed, no constitutional or diplomatic reform would have substance."
 china_wr.22.a:0 "A nation cannot ignore its starving people."
 china_wr.23.t:0 "Dialogue with the Chinese Youth Party: The Path Toward Constitution and Liberty"
 china_wr.23.d:0 "The Chinese Youth Party’s presidential candidate arrived with a calm demeanor, carrying not briefcases of statistics but constitutional drafts and treatises on political theory. From the first greeting, he declared the Sichuan famine to be "a tragedy born of political failure and the collapse of constitutional order."\n\nAccording to his explanation, early warnings of famine failed to translate into effective action because administrative information was distorted by factional interests, and systems of oversight and checks had ceased to function. He emphasized restoring separation of powers, guaranteeing the independence of the legislature and judiciary, and securing press and civil freedoms—building a ‘constitutional state’ where institutions function automatically even in crises.\n\nYan Huiqing questioned whether these ideals could survive the chaos of real politics, and how one might confront resistance from radicals or entrenched bureaucratic and military elites. The Youth Party candidate argued that only gradual reform and broad social compromise—not emotional agitation—could open the path forward. As the conversation ended, Yan Huiqing felt anew the difficulty of preserving both ‘liberty’ and ‘order’ together."
 china_wr.23.a:0 "Without constitutional order, all reforms are houses built on sand."
 china_wr.24.t:0 "Dialogue with the Kuomintang: The Mandate of Reunification"
 china_wr.24.d:0 "The Kuomintang’s presidential candidate arrived with solemnity unmatched by the others. After a brief greeting, he insisted that the roots of the famine, economic insecurity, and political unrest converged into a single fundamental cause: Manchuria and Mongolia lie under the control of the Man-Mongol State and foreign influence, while treaty ports and extraterritorial enclaves siphon the wealth of China.\n\nHe listed the grain, minerals, railways, and port concessions flowing from the territories held by the Man-Mongol State, and the foreign powers and domestic elites who exploit the treaty port system. The Kuomintang’s ‘Northern Expedition and Reunification’ policy, he asserted, was not reckless militarism, but the inevitable mission of overthrowing the Man-Mongol regime, recovering the lost northern lands, and restoring national legitimacy. Only then, he claimed, could tragedies like Sichuan truly be prevented.\n\nYan Huiqing expressed concern that another military mobilization could bring further bloodshed, and whether the weary populace could endure renewed conflict. But the Kuomintang candidate replied that "peace without reunification is an illusion," and insisted that only after reclaiming the North could genuine reform and welfare become possible. The dialogue ended in sustained tension."

 china_wr.25.t:0 "Progressive Speeches Echo Through the Factory Districts"
 china_wr.25.d:0 "To secure the support of the working class in the upcoming presidential election, the Progressive Party has dispatched concentrated campaign teams to major industrial cities and port districts. Party leaders and candidates time their speeches to coincide with shift changes, addressing workers at factory gates in the early morning and visiting union halls and factory canteens after hours to explain their pledges in detail.\n\nThey emphasize that the Sichuan famine is not merely a tragedy of the countryside, but a ‘national crisis’ that has also brought wage stagnation, layoffs, and soaring prices to urban workers. The Progressives present concrete legislative goals, including shorter working hours, stronger safety regulations, the introduction of unemployment insurance and workplace injury compensation, and the phased adoption of a minimum wage system, appealing that "this election may be the first real chance to change workers’ lives."\n\nExhausted workers remain skeptical about politics, but in some workplaces the name of the Progressive Party is being discussed seriously for the first time. The speeches rising between the factory chimneys are still faint, yet they signal a new political possibility."

 china_wr.26.d:0 "As the election draws closer, the Republic’s political landscape is becoming increasingly polarized. On one side, some shout for radical social revolution and class struggle; on the other, voices call for a hard-line Northern Expedition and unification by force. Newspapers and streets alike are filled with competing slogans. In this climate, moderates within the Progressive Party and the Chinese Youth Party, together with non-aligned intellectuals, have quietly begun to put their heads together.\n\nThey remind one another that the lesson of the Sichuan famine lies not in extreme ideological agitation but in responsible administration and gradual reform. Despite their different ideological backgrounds, they seek common ground in the defense of constitutional government and the stabilization of people’s livelihoods. In some regions, the Progressives and the Youth Party have even appeared side by side, refraining from personal attacks and holding joint policy forums—an unusual sight by any standard.\n\nThis movement for a centrist alliance remains a subtle undercurrent rather than an obvious tide, but it is slowly winning support among citizens disillusioned with politics and among academics and professionals. The future of the Republic may well depend on which direction this quiet coalition ultimately chooses to throw its weight."

 china_wr.27.d:0 "As election fever gradually rises, the Jiangnan region has seen violent groups and local strongmen exploit the confusion to expand their influence. According to reports, some of these organizations have formed ties with particular parties, using intimidation to disrupt rival campaigns or coerce merchants and residents into backing a single side.\n\nIn response, the central government has announced a major security crackdown throughout Jiangnan, launching joint operations involving police, gendarmerie, and army security units. Illegal gatherings, unlicensed gambling dens, and hidden weapons caches are being raided in succession, and news of the arrest of key figures within several gangs continues to arrive. While some parties suspect political motives and voice their displeasure, many residents of Jiangnan quietly hope that, at least during the election period, violence in the streets will subside.\n\nDebate will surely continue over whether this operation truly serves ‘equality before the law’ or is in part a means of restraining certain political forces. One fact, however, is undeniable: any election conducted under the shadow of guns and threats cannot defend the name of the Republic."

 china_wr.28.d:0 "Even as the Jiangnan crackdown publicly proclaims the ‘elimination of lawless elements’ and the ‘establishment of electoral order’, a very different development is being reported from behind the scenes. Some Kuomintang figures are said to be making unofficial contact with the Green Gang, the powerful criminal organization that dominates much of Shanghai.\n\nThe Green Gang commands broad mobilization power and an extensive information network reaching from dockworkers and stevedores to the urban poor. Cooperation with them could become a potent tool for controlling the atmosphere of elections in specific districts and quietly obstructing the activities of rival parties. In fact, rumors already circulate that campaign rallies for Kuomintang candidates seem curiously ‘quiet and orderly’ around certain ports and markets.\n\nYet such arrangements amount to a dangerous choice that undermines the foundations of the Republic’s rule of law and party politics. Though they may bring short-term advantages at the ballot box, the price will be steep if the day comes when the Green Gang demands influence over central power. Even so, some politicians have chosen to roll these dice, chasing immediate victory."

They argued that holding an election while public security and administration have yet to recover is nothing more than "a ploy to blind the starving people and manipulate the vote," and openly appealed to Sichuan voters to refrain from participating.\n\nThe Sichuan branch went on to declare that "the boycott is the only and unavoidable measure to prevent the political exploitation of famine-stricken regions," and accused the authorities of "deliberately neglecting the famine for political gain."\n\nHowever, other parties in Sichuan and most newspapers are condemning this announcement as "a political maneuver born of fear of defeat," and even some Kuomintang members themselves have voiced concern over their branch’s statements. Among the people of Sichuan, the prevailing sentiment is one of bitter cynicism: "Those who have done nothing but disturb our province for months now claim to speak for us and tell us to abandon our rights."\n\nUpon hearing the declaration, the national leadership of the Kuomintang hurriedly issued a statement insisting that the Sichuan branch acted "entirely on its own," urging supporters across the country to "exercise your precious vote for the Kuomintang," a message that has only deepened confusion among the party’s supporters."

As the election approaches, however, the station has gradually stepped into the forefront of explicit political campaigning.\n\nRather than openly attacking specific parties, the broadcast addresses sensitive topics such as the Sichuan famine, the promise of early elections, and constitutional debate, while repeatedly stressing the importance of ‘procedural legitimacy’ and ‘checks against abuse of power’. Expert discussion panels, talk shows aimed at youth, and live segments reporting from the provinces all serve to propagate the Youth Party’s platform of moderate reform and constitutional defense in a natural and persuasive manner.\n\nAmong urban intellectuals and students, as well as citizens in smaller cities who rely on radio for information, it is said that one cannot speak of politics without listening to ‘Voice of Freedom’. Though the station officially denies being a propaganda arm of any particular party, there is little doubt that its influence will weigh heavily on the outcome of the election."

The speakers who took the stage avoided complex statistics or theoretical jargon; instead, they shared testimonies heard directly from famine-stricken villages and stories of hardship witnessed in factories, ports, and marketplaces. The crowd responded at times with solemn silence, and at others with thunderous applause. The Progressive Party’s message—that politics must no longer descend from above, but rise from the lived experiences of the people—set the entire rally ablaze.\n\nAt the height of the gathering, the party leadership unveiled the core framework of the ‘Equal Livelihood for All’ program. The phased introduction of a minimum wage, strengthened safety nets for food, housing, and healthcare, revisions to labor protection laws, and policies for balanced regional economic development presented a tangible vision for the future, resonating powerfully with the attendees. Many lingered around the venue long after the speeches ended, discussing their hopes and fears, and quietly acknowledging that politics might once again reconnect with the realities of everyday life.\n\nWhether this rally will become a historic turning point that reshapes the political landscape of the Republic remains to be seen. Yet one truth has become unmistakably clear: when the people begin to raise their own voices, the direction of politics inevitably begins to move toward their lives."

He went on to argue that "China’s entire social structure throttles personal freedom, scholarly inquiry, and every possibility for progress." Several panelists stormed out in protest, but Hu Shih continued unfazed.\n\nHe then turned his attention to censorship and the violence employed by warlords and political factions. "What harms a nation is not freedom," he said, "but the maggots in the latrine who parade around under the banner of freedom." The hall fell into a stunned silence.\n\nThe most controversial portion concerned youth and women. Hu Shih asserted that "A half-hungry, half-educated youth is worth a hundred well-fed old men who refuse to learn," calling for full educational and economic access for women and the poor. When reporters later asked whether his proposals were too radical, he replied, "If anyone thinks this is radical, it merely proves how outdated they’ve become."\n\nHis remarks provoked thunderous applause from reformists and students, while enraging conservative attendees — a clear sign that a political storm is brewing."

Using these accounts, the party leadership is presenting the ‘Equal Livelihood Package,’ which includes a phased minimum wage, stabilization of food distribution, improved labor protections, and balanced regional development.\n\nThis hearing is not a simple campaign event but a demonstration that the party is directly connecting public testimony to policymaking.

 china_wr.34.d:0 "The Chinese Youth Party is organizing a nationwide constitutional reform forum to elaborate on its platform of ‘Civil Rights and Constitution.’ The party argues that the failures revealed by the Sichuan crisis stem from concentrated power and a lack of oversight, and that restoring constitutional order is the first step toward rebuilding the republic.\n\nThe forum discusses strengthening parliamentary authority, securing judicial independence, expanding press freedoms, energizing civil society, and redefining central–regional power balances. Scholars warn that a state whose institutions do not protect citizens is doomed to collapse in every crisis, while younger intellectuals are showing strong interest and actively participating in debate.\n\nThrough this forum, the Chinese Youth Party is emphasizing that its agenda is not mere rhetoric but a practical plan to restore constitutional governance."

 china_wr.35.d:0 "The Nationalist Party has designated the Manchuria–Mongolia regime as the primary cause of the republic’s stagnation, and is holding a nationwide strategy conference to advance its platform of ‘Northern Reunification.’\n\nThe conference highlights that the railways, minerals, and ports controlled by the Manchuria–Mongolia state—and the wealth leaking from foreign concessions and extraterritorial zones—are preventing the republic’s recovery. The leadership is presenting a long-term strategy involving territorial restoration, securing railway networks, reorganizing logistics, and reinforcing border defense.\n\nThis event demonstrates that the Nationalist Party views the Northern Expedition not as a mere display of force but as an essential process to restore national legitimacy. The party’s base is rallying tightly, and the cause of reunification is becoming central to the nation’s political discourse."

 china_wr.36.d:0 "Reports from Sichuan indicate that the devastating famine has finally entered a period of stabilization. Relief shipments along the Yangtze, renewed provincial support, and restored local administration have sharply reduced the number of starvation cases. Security in the region is also recovering, allowing daily life to slowly return to order.\n\nWith the crisis no longer at its peak, preparations for the postponed presidential election may now resume. Though the scars left on the people of Sichuan remain deep, many within the Republic insist that the political schedule can no longer be delayed.\n\nThe central government has thus declared a return to normal electoral procedures, signaling that the Republic must once again move forward."

Cai E of the Progressive Party, Hu Shih of the Chinese Youth Party, and Wang Jingwei of the Kuomintang — these three candidates have fiercely competed to define the Republic’s future in their own ways.\n\nThe voters carefully weighed three different visions—livelihood, liberty, and national reunification—while the candidates traveled across the country, appealing for support until the very last moment. With the long process of voting and counting now complete, the Republic stands ready to welcome a new leader who will open a new chapter for the nation.\n\nThe final result of the election is about to be announced."
