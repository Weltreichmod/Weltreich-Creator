 china_wr.1.t:0 "Reintroduction of the Conscription Law Amendment"
 china_wr.1.d:0 "Near the end of Cao Kun's administration, the National Assembly attempted to pass an amendment to the conscription law in order to suppress the warlord militia system and centralize military authority. However, Cao Kun vetoed the proposal, preventing even proper discussion. As a result, the bill was discarded entirely. Soon after, the nation fell into rapid political turmoil, and Zhang Xueliang's unauthorized Northern Expedition, combined with the worsening Northeastern crisis, made fundamental reform of the conscription system unavoidable.\n\nThe Provisional Government of Yan Huiqing is now pushing once again to revise the conscription law to stabilize military command and dismantle the remaining warlord power structures. The new amendment includes not only the previously debated issues—such as transparent conscription procedures, the legal status of militias, and centralization of force organization—but also new provisions designed to prevent further unauthorized troop mobilizations as seen recently.\n\nIf the amendment passes, the Republic will finally be able to restore a military system firmly under central control. However, warlord-aligned legislators and numerous regional representatives strongly oppose the reform, fearing that their local power bases will be weakened. The provisional government cannot avoid confronting this challenge; it must resolve the matter decisively."
 china_wr.1.a:0 "One step at a time."
 china_wr.2.t_desc:0 "Partial Acceptance of the Cao Kun Reform"
 china_wr.2.d_desc:0 "The so-called 'Cao Kun Reform,' imposed unilaterally by Cao Kun, introduced direct presidential elections, extensive redistricting, and a greatly expanded legislature, leaving the political order of the Republic deeply destabilized. After the collapse of his regime, the reform remained unresolved and continued to fuel factional conflict.\n\nThe Provisional Government of Yan Huiqing now chooses to selectively accept only the essential components of the reform, rather than abolishing it entirely. This approach aims to reclaim administrative authority from the warlords and to restore coherence in the Republic's electoral and administrative institutions.\n\nAlthough this measure brings short-term political cost, it is a necessary step toward restoring stability to the Republic."
 china_wr.2.a_desc:0 "The state must move forward with stability."
 china_wr.3.t:0 "Full Acceptance of the Cao Kun Reform"
 china_wr.3.d:0 "The Provisional Government of Yan Huiqing has determined that the partial acceptance of the Cao Kun Reform is insufficient to restore the full constitutional order of the Republic. After reviewing the entire structure of the reform, the government has decided to reintroduce its core components as a comprehensive system.\n\nThis measure stabilizes the central government's authority by reorganizing the direct presidential election system, redistricting laws, and the expanded legislature under unified standards. It will also weaken the entrenched regional power of the warlord factions. Nevertheless, the decision is expected to trigger political friction and temporary social instability.\n\nEven so, this 'full acceptance' is a necessary hardship for the Republic to regain institutional coherence and move forward."
 china_wr.3.a:0 "A necessary decision."
 china_wr.4.t:0 "Opening Negotiations with Japan"
 china_wr.4.d:0 "The unauthorized advance of the Northeastern Army and their looting near the Japanese concession in the Kwantung region has provoked strong Japanese protests. The Yan Huiqing Provisional Government fears that further escalation may invite military pressure from Japan.\n\nTo defuse the situation, an official envoy has been dispatched to Japan. The envoy conveyed the government's regret, clarifying that the Northeastern Army acted independently. To conclude the incident swiftly, the government has proposed a temporary transfer of Southern railway construction rights.\n\nThis concession may be humiliating, but it may be necessary to avert immediate disaster."
 china_wr.4.a:0 "Deliver the proposal to Japan."
 china_wr.5.t:0 "China's Explanation and Concession Proposal"
 china_wr.5.d:0 "A Chinese delegation has delivered an official statement clarifying that the recent looting and unauthorized advance of the Northeastern Army near the Kwantung concession were entirely independent actions, carried out without the approval or knowledge of the central government. The delegation expressed deep regret for the disturbance and formally apologized for the incident.\n\nTo resolve the situation swiftly and ease tensions between both nations, China has proposed a temporary transfer of Southern railway construction rights to Japan. This concession appears intended to both compensate for the incident and stabilize diplomatic relations.\n\nThe Japanese government must now decide whether to accept this explanation and proposal."
 china_wr.5.a:0 "Accept China's explanation and review the offer."
 china_wr.5.b:0 "Their explanation is insufficient. Stronger measures are required."
 china_wr.6.t:0 "Japan Accepts the Agreement"
 china_wr.6.d:0 "The Japanese government has accepted our explanation and apology, and has agreed to the temporary transfer of Southern railway construction rights. With Japan easing its diplomatic pressure, the immediate crisis appears to have subsided.\n\nThe Yan Huiqing Provisional Government argues that this was an unavoidable measure to prevent a larger conflict. However, domestic criticism is slowly emerging, accusing the government of making a humiliating compromise. Even so, the conclusion of these negotiations has undoubtedly bought the government some much-needed time."
 china_wr.6.a:0 "For now, the crisis has passed."
 china_wr.7.t:0 "Japan Rejects the Proposal"
 china_wr.7.d:0 "The Japanese government has rejected our explanation, refusal to accept our apology, and dismissed the proposed temporary transfer of Southern railway construction rights. Japan contends that the Northeastern Army's unauthorized actions demonstrate the Chinese government's inability to maintain control.\n\nRecognizing the severity of the situation, the Yan Huiqing Provisional Government has begun preparing emergency countermeasures. While both the public and the National Assembly condemn Japan's stance, there is growing fear that Japan may escalate pressure or even take military action.\n\nThe political climate is once again descending into uncertainty."

 china_wr.9.t:0 "Official Report on the Sichuan Situation"
 china_wr.9.d:0 "Mr. Acting President,\n\nI respectfully submit the following summary of the reports received from Sichuan regarding recent agricultural conditions and local sentiment. Certain counties have observed a modest decline in this year's harvest, though local authorities emphasize that the matter remains localized and poses no significant risk to the province's overall production capacity. While a temporary rise in grain prices has led to minor public concern, corrective measures have reportedly been implemented, and conditions are said to be stabilizing.\n\nThere was a minor incident along the Yangtze River during the transport of goods, attributed to a simple misunderstanding. Local security units intervened promptly, and the likelihood of further escalation is assessed to be low. Administrative and security functions throughout the province are reported to be operating normally, with no signs of broader instability.\n\nIn conclusion, the situation in Sichuan is deemed manageable at the provincial level, and there is no current indication that immediate intervention from the central government is required."
 china_wr.9.a:0 "Continue monitoring.
 china_wr.10.t:0 "The Sichuan Famine"
 china_wr.10.d:0 "Reports from Sichuan indicate that what began as localized crop failures and food shortages has now escalated into a full-scale famine. Some county-level documents already speak of widespread starvation and mass flight from the countryside, while rumors suggest that local officials may be underreporting the severity of the crisis for fear of censure from above.\n\nUntil now, the central government has attempted to manage the situation as a mere 'threat of famine', but it is no longer possible to treat it as a limited regional disaster. The Sichuan crisis has become more than a natural calamity; it is a grave test of the Republic's administrative, logistical, and security capabilities. We must now formally acknowledge this as a national emergency and prepare for a prolonged campaign of relief and reconstruction."
 china_wr.10.a:0 "This is where the real work begins."
 china_wr.11.t:0 "Famine Sweeps Through Sichuan"
 china_wr.11.d:0 "News has spread that an unprecedented famine is ravaging western China. In the rural and mountainous districts of Sichuan, harvests have collapsed, and weak transport and distribution networks have failed to deliver food to either towns or villages. Foreign correspondents report columns of refugees fleeing hunger, empty marketplaces, and villages haunted by rumors of starvation.\n\nThe Chinese central government has declared the crisis a 'national disaster' and announced emergency measures, yet there is growing doubt as to whether it has the finances and administrative capacity to follow through. The international community now watches closely to see whether China's political system can withstand this humanitarian and political shock."
 china_wr.11.a:0 "Hunger recognizes no borders."
 china_wr.12.t:0 "Relief Reaches Sichuan"
 china_wr.12.d:0 "After long delays and countless obstacles, the first large-scale relief shipments have finally begun to reach Sichuan. Central convoys and military transport units have managed to bypass collapsed bridges and ruined roads, using river routes, improvised docks, and mountain passes to push supplies into several key hubs across the province.\n\nTemporary distribution points and clinics have been established in county seats, with food and medicine allocated first to the hardest-hit communities. Supplies remain far from sufficient to cover the entire region, but reports indicate that the number of people collapsing from hunger has begun to fall. The operation has not yet turned the tide of the famine, but it has shown that the disaster can, at least in part, be pushed back."
 china_wr.12.a:0 "At last, we can catch our breath—if only slightly."
 china_wr.13.t:0 "The Cancelled Early Election"
 china_wr.13.d:0 "Amid the Sichuan famine and nationwide unrest, the early presidential election that the government once promised has, in practice, been postponed indefinitely. Many regions have not even completed their voter registries; refugees, public disorder, and administrative paralysis have made it impossible to guarantee a fair and orderly vote.\n\nThe government presents this as an unavoidable administrative necessity, but neither the public nor the parties are inclined to accept that explanation at face value. Opposition leaders and newspapers accuse the authorities of using the crisis as a pretext to extend their grip on power, while ordinary citizens complain that they have lost not only their livelihoods but also their political voice. The cancellation of the early election adds a new layer of distrust atop the tragedy unfolding in Sichuan."
 china_wr.13.a:0 "In times of crisis, political trust is the first to crumble."
 china_wr.14.t:0 "Appeal to the Great Powers"
 china_wr.14.d:0 "As the Sichuan famine drags on, the central government has been forced to admit that it cannot manage the crisis alone. It has therefore dispatched formal appeals for aid to the major powers of the world, including detailed reports on the scale of the disaster, estimated casualties, and the urgent need for food, medicine, and technical assistance.\n\nSome argued that national pride and the principle of non-interference should prevent foreign involvement in China's internal affairs. In the end, however, the prospect of saving millions of lives outweighed such concerns. The international community must now decide how to respond, balancing humanitarian ideals against strategic interests."
 china_wr.14.a:0 "We have no choice but to extend our hand for help."
 china_wr.15.t:0 "China's Appeal Reaches [FROM.GetName]"
 china_wr.15.d:0 "The government of China has formally approached [ROOT.GetName], along with several other nations, requesting assistance in confronting the famine in Sichuan and other western regions. Their appeal asks for shipments of food and medicine, expert personnel, and even technical advice on how to move supplies safely into the interior.\n\nOur response will mean more than a few cargo ships or trainloads of grain. The decision taken by the [ROOT.GetAdjective] government will shape our future relationship with China, influence global opinion, and serve as a test of the civilizational and humanitarian values we claim to uphold."
 china_wr.15.a:0 "Approve the aid, in the name of humanity."
 china_wr.15.b:0 "This is not our concern; we shall not intervene."
 china_wr.16.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Approves Relief"
 china_wr.16.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has agreed to our request for assistance in dealing with the Sichuan famine. They have officially pledged to send food, medical supplies, and personnel, and have offered to allocate part of their ports and transport capacity specifically for shipments bound for China.\n\nThis aid alone will not resolve the crisis, but rumors of 'foreign grain' have already begun to spread in warehouses and distribution centers. To ensure that this support is used as effectively as possible, the central government has decided to establish a special committee to oversee allocation and transport."
 china_wr.16.a:0 "We must remember this act of goodwill."
 china_wr.17.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses Relief"
 china_wr.17.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has politely but firmly refused our appeal for aid in the Sichuan famine. Citing domestic conditions, budgetary constraints, or diplomatic considerations, they have declared that they cannot participate directly in the relief effort.\n\nThe language of their diplomatic note is cautious and courteous, yet it offers us nothing tangible. Some officials mutter that our expectations were unrealistic from the start; others are angered by what they see as international indifference to China's suffering."
 china_wr.17.a:0 "We will have to endure with what we have."
 china_wr.18.t:0 "Outcome of the Relief Effort"
 china_wr.18.desc.a:0 "We sent appeals for aid to many nations, laying bare the full extent of the famine in Sichuan. Yet the replies we received were cold and distant. Not a single country has committed to providing meaningful assistance; most limit themselves to expressions of 'regret' and careful diplomatic distancing.\n\nIn the end, no outside power will come to save Sichuan. With limited resources and a fragile logistical framework, the Republic must face this disaster largely unaided. The lesson is harsh but unmistakable: we cannot entrust the fate of the nation to the goodwill of others."
 china_wr.18.desc.b:0 "Only a handful of countries responded positively to our desperate appeals, but those that did have offered food, medicine, and personnel. Their contributions will help ease the worst suffering in the hardest-hit areas and may prevent the famine from descending into total catastrophe.\n\nEven so, vast stretches of Sichuan's fields and mountain villages remain beyond the reach of any relief program. This international assistance is not a cure but a brace to keep a collapsing structure standing a little longer. We must use it wisely, while searching for longer-term solutions of our own."
 china_wr.18.desc.c:0 "Our appeals have borne fruit: nearly every nation we approached has agreed to assist. Shipments of grain and medicine are arriving in steadily increasing volumes, and foreign experts and volunteers are joining relief operations across Sichuan.\n\nNo amount of aid can bring back the lives already lost, but this unprecedented wave of support has prevented the famine from becoming a permanent, entrenched disaster. At the same time, it offers China a chance to rebuild its credibility as a responsible member of the international community."
 china_wr.18.a:0 "In the end, we can rely only on ourselves."
 china_wr.18.b:0 "At least we may have a chance to avoid the very worst."
 china_wr.18.c:0 "We must wring every last benefit from the aid we have received."
 china_wr.18.d:0 "One day, we shall repay these debts of honor."
 china_wr.19.t:0 "Promise of an Early Election"
 china_wr.19.d:0 "As distrust in the central government mounts amid the Sichuan famine and subsequent disturbances, Acting President Yan Huiqing has publicly pledged to hold an early general election as a means of restoring political stability. He has declared that, once the immediate emergency has eased, new presidential and parliamentary elections will be held regardless of the current terms of office.\n\nThis promise does not resolve the crisis overnight, but it has at least softened fears that the incumbent authorities intend to cling to power indefinitely. The people and the parties will now watch closely to see whether this pledge is merely a stalling tactic, or the first genuine step toward the restoration of constitutional order."
 china_wr.19.a:0 "Only by keeping our word can we hope to regain trust."
 china_wr.20.t:0 "The End of the Sichuan Famine"
 china_wr.20.d:0 "The great famine that has weighed upon the Republic for years has finally entered a phase of stabilization. The large-scale relief operations utilizing the Yangtze river network, the nationwide logistics mobilization order, and the limited but crucial international assistance have collectively taken effect. Even in the regions that suffered the worst starvation, organized reports of mass death are no longer being received.\n\nOf course, scars remain across Sichuan's fields and mountain villages. Families torn apart, indebted households crushed by loans, and refugees who have yet to return home all stand as living reminders of this disaster's long shadow. Even so, the central government now judges that the worst stage—'mass starvation'—has been averted, and preparations must begin to transition from emergency relief to long-term recovery and reconstruction.\n\nThe Sichuan famine has revealed both the capabilities and limitations of the Republic. What remains is not simply to remember this tragedy as a natural disaster, but to treat it as a starting point for reforming our institutions, administration, and economic structures."
 china_wr.20.a:0 "Now begins the time for recovery—and accountability."
 china_wr.21.t:0 "The Acting President's Choice"
 china_wr.21.d:0 "As the Sichuan famine enters a stable phase and preparations for the early presidential election accelerate, the political focus of the Republic has returned to the question of who shall become the next President. Acting President Yan Huiqing, who has guided the nation through recent turmoil, has decided to hold informal discussions with the major candidates who may shape the Republic's future.\n\nThe Progressive Party raises the banner of 'People's Welfare and Equal Livelihood,' arguing that the most urgent task is restoring the lives of the starving and impoverished masses. The Young China Party promotes 'Constitutional Democracy,' insisting that the Sichuan tragedy was the result of outdated political practices and disregard for constitutional norms. The Kuomintang advances 'Northern Expedition and Reunification,' warning that without resolving the Manchurian–Mongolian question and the unequal treaty ports, any reform would remain incomplete.\n\nYan Huiqing intends to speak individually with prominent figures from each party, directly examining their diagnoses of the Republic's crisis and their proposed solutions. His reflections and choices will serve as a critical milestone in determining the landscape of the coming election."

 china_wr.21.b:0 "Discuss constitutional order with the Young China Party."
 china_wr.21.c:0 "Discuss reunification with the Kuomintang."
 china_wr.22.t:0 "Dialogue with the Progressive Party"
 china_wr.22.d:0 "Acting President Yan Huiqing invited the Progressive Party's presidential candidate, Cai E, to a private meeting to discuss the direction the Republic should take after the Sichuan famine. From the very beginning, Cai E declared that 'politics is livelihood itself' and shared vivid accounts of farmers and workers he had met in the famine-stricken regions.\n\nHe argued that the disaster was not the result of mere crop failure but a structural crisis caused by unequal land systems, weak labor protections, indifferent local administration, and the absence of a social welfare framework. He then presented the 'Balanced Livelihood' policy package, outlining tax reforms, financial restructuring, and a roadmap for regional economic balancing.\n\nYan Huiqing questioned whether these reforms would exceed the nation's fiscal and administrative capacity. Yet by the end of the discussion, he could not deny one fact: unless the wounds of Sichuan were healed, any constitutional or diplomatic reform would remain hollow."
 china_wr.22.a:0 "A politics that ignores the hungry cannot exist."
 china_wr.23.t:0 "Dialogue with the Young China Party"
 china_wr.23.d:0 "The presidential candidate of the Young China Party, Hu Shih, arrived carrying a draft constitution and several works on political theory. He began by declaring the Sichuan famine a 'failure of governance and a tragedy born from the collapse of constitutional order.'\n\nAccording to him, despite early warning signs, effective action was impossible because political power had concentrated into the hands of a few, distorting administrative information and crippling the mechanisms of oversight. He emphasized restoring the separation of powers, guaranteeing the independence of parliament and judiciary, and protecting the freedom of the press and civil society.\n\nYan Huiqing questioned whether such ideals could truly be implemented amid the chaos of real politics and how Hu Shih planned to confront resistance from radical elements and authoritarian bureaucrats. Hu Shih stressed that gradual reform and social compromise—not emotional agitation—were the only viable path. By the end of the discussion, Yan Huiqing was reminded how difficult it is to safeguard both liberty and order."
 china_wr.23.a:0 "Without constitutional order, any reform is a house built on sand."
 china_wr.24.t:0 "Dialogue with the Kuomintang"
 china_wr.24.d:0 "Kuomintang presidential candidate Wang Jingwei attended the meeting with solemn determination. He asserted that the root cause behind Sichuan's chaos, economic instability, and political division lay in one simple fact: the northern territories remained under the influence of foreign powers and the Manchuria-Mongolia regime.\n\nWang Jingwei detailed how grain, minerals, and railway concessions were flowing out of Manchuria and Mongolia, and how treaty ports and extraterritorial zones drained China's wealth. He argued that the 'Northern Expedition for Unification' was not a reckless adventure but the only way to restore national legitimacy and end the cycle of exploitation.\n\nYan Huiqing expressed concern that such a military campaign might spark further bloodshed and whether the exhausted population could bear new mobilizations. Wang Jingwei countered that 'peace without unification is an illusion,' insisting that only by reclaiming the north could reform and welfare become possible. The tense dialogue ended without reconciliation."
 china_wr.24.a:0 "We must carefully weigh the cost of unification."
 china_wr.25.t:0 "Progressive Speeches Echo Through the Factory Districts"
 china_wr.25.d:0 "To secure the support of the working class in the upcoming presidential election, the Progressive Party has dispatched concentrated campaign teams to major industrial cities and port districts. Party leaders and candidates time their speeches to coincide with shift changes, addressing workers at factory gates in the early morning and visiting union halls and factory canteens after hours to explain their pledges in detail.\n\nThey emphasize that the Sichuan famine is not merely a tragedy of the countryside, but a 'national crisis' that has also brought wage stagnation, layoffs, and soaring prices to urban workers. The Progressives present concrete legislative goals, including shorter working hours, stronger safety regulations, the introduction of unemployment insurance and workplace injury compensation, and the phased adoption of a minimum wage system, appealing that "this election may be the first real chance to change workers' lives."\n\nExhausted workers remain skeptical about politics, but in some workplaces the name of the Progressive Party is being discussed seriously for the first time. The speeches rising between the factory chimneys are still faint, yet they signal a new political possibility."
 china_wr.25.a:0 "Politics has finally come to the factory gate."
 china_wr.26.t:0 "Intellectuals and Moderates Seek a Centrist Alliance"
 china_wr.26.d:0 "As the election draws closer, the Republic's political landscape is becoming increasingly polarized. On one side, some shout for radical social revolution and class struggle; on the other, voices call for a hard-line Northern Expedition and unification by force. Newspapers and streets alike are filled with competing slogans. In this climate, moderates within the Progressive Party and the Young China Party, together with non-aligned intellectuals, have quietly begun to put their heads together.\n\nThey remind one another that the lesson of the Sichuan famine lies not in extreme ideological agitation but in responsible administration and gradual reform. Despite their different ideological backgrounds, they seek common ground in the defense of constitutional government and the stabilization of people's livelihoods. In some regions, the Progressives and the Youth Party have even appeared side by side, refraining from personal attacks and holding joint policy forums—an unusual sight by any standard.\n\nThis movement for a centrist alliance remains a subtle undercurrent rather than an obvious tide, but it is slowly winning support among citizens disillusioned with politics and among academics and professionals. The future of the Republic may well depend on which direction this quiet coalition ultimately chooses to throw its weight."

 china_wr.27.d:0 "As election fever gradually rises, the Jiangnan region has seen violent groups and local strongmen exploit the confusion to expand their influence. According to reports, some of these organizations have formed ties with particular parties, using intimidation to disrupt rival campaigns or coerce merchants and residents into backing a single side.\n\nIn response, the central government has announced a major security crackdown throughout Jiangnan, launching joint operations involving police, gendarmerie, and army security units. Illegal gatherings, unlicensed gambling dens, and hidden weapons caches are being raided in succession, and news of the arrest of key figures within several gangs continues to arrive. While some parties suspect political motives and voice their displeasure, many residents of Jiangnan quietly hope that, at least during the election period, violence in the streets will subside.\n\nDebate will surely continue over whether this operation truly serves 'equality before the law' or is in part a means of restraining certain political forces. One fact, however, is undeniable: any election conducted under the shadow of guns and threats cannot defend the name of the Republic."
 china_wr.27.a:0 "An election held to the sound of gunfire can no longer be tolerated."
 china_wr.28.t:0 "Politicians Strike a Bargain with the Green Gang"
 china_wr.28.d:0 "Even as the Jiangnan crackdown publicly proclaims the 'elimination of lawless elements' and the 'establishment of electoral order', a very different development is being reported from behind the scenes. Some Kuomintang figures are said to be making unofficial contact with the Green Gang, the powerful criminal organization that dominates much of Shanghai.\n\nThe Green Gang commands broad mobilization power and an extensive information network reaching from dockworkers and stevedores to the urban poor. Cooperation with them could become a potent tool for controlling the atmosphere of elections in specific districts and quietly obstructing the activities of rival parties. In fact, rumors already circulate that campaign rallies for Kuomintang candidates seem curiously 'quiet and orderly' around certain ports and markets.\n\nYet such arrangements amount to a dangerous choice that undermines the foundations of the Republic's rule of law and party politics. Though they may bring short-term advantages at the ballot box, the price will be steep if the day comes when the Green Gang demands influence over central power. Even so, some politicians have chosen to roll these dice, chasing immediate victory."

 china_wr.29.d:0 "As the situation in Sichuan continues to deteriorate, the provincial branch of the Kuomintang has escalated its criticism of the authorities and, during a rally held earlier today, abruptly announced a full 'election boycott.' They argued that holding an election while public security and administration have yet to recover is nothing more than "a ploy to blind the starving people and manipulate the vote," and openly appealed to Sichuan voters to refrain from participating.\n\nThe Sichuan branch went on to declare that "the boycott is the only and unavoidable measure to prevent the political exploitation of famine-stricken regions," and accused the authorities of "deliberately neglecting the famine for political gain."\n\nHowever, other parties in Sichuan and most newspapers are condemning this announcement as "a political maneuver born of fear of defeat," and even some Kuomintang members themselves have voiced concern over their branch's statements. Among the people of Sichuan, the prevailing sentiment is one of bitter cynicism: "Those who have done nothing but disturb our province for months now claim to speak for us and tell us to abandon our rights."\n\nUpon hearing the declaration, the national leadership of the Kuomintang hurriedly issued a statement insisting that the Sichuan branch acted "entirely on its own," urging supporters across the country to "exercise your precious vote for the Kuomintang," a message that has only deepened confusion among the party's supporters."

 china_wr.30.d:0 "The radio program 'Voice of Freedom', operated by the Young China Party, has long been known as an educational broadcast dealing with constitutionalism, the rule of law, and social issues. As the election approaches, however, the station has gradually stepped into the forefront of explicit political campaigning.\n\nRather than openly attacking specific parties, the broadcast addresses sensitive topics such as the Sichuan famine, the promise of early elections, and constitutional debate, while repeatedly stressing the importance of 'procedural legitimacy' and 'checks against abuse of power'. Expert discussion panels, talk shows aimed at youth, and live segments reporting from the provinces all serve to propagate the Youth Party's platform of moderate reform and constitutional defense in a natural and persuasive manner.\n\nAmong urban intellectuals and students, as well as citizens in smaller cities who rely on radio for information, it is said that one cannot speak of politics without listening to 'Voice of Freedom'. Though the station officially denies being a propaganda arm of any particular party, there is little doubt that its influence will weigh heavily on the outcome of the election."

 china_wr.31.d:0 "Seeking to rebuild public trust shattered by the Sichuan famine, the Progressive Party has decided to hold a nationwide 'Mass Rally for the People.' The party leadership judged that debates confined to meeting rooms or arguments printed on newspaper columns could no longer contain the cries of livelihood and suffering.\n\nFrom dawn, workers, students, and ordinary citizens flooded the square, carrying red flags and handmade placards. The speakers who took the stage avoided complex statistics or theoretical jargon; instead, they shared testimonies heard directly from famine-stricken villages and stories of hardship witnessed in factories, ports, and marketplaces. The crowd responded at times with solemn silence, and at others with thunderous applause. The Progressive Party's message—that politics must no longer descend from above, but rise from the lived experiences of the people—set the entire rally ablaze.\n\nAt the height of the gathering, the party leadership unveiled the core framework of the 'Equal Livelihood for All' program. The phased introduction of a minimum wage, strengthened safety nets for food, housing, and healthcare, revisions to labor protection laws, and policies for balanced regional economic development presented a tangible vision for the future, resonating powerfully with the attendees. Many lingered around the venue long after the speeches ended, discussing their hopes and fears, and quietly acknowledging that politics might once again reconnect with the realities of everyday life.\n\nWhether this rally will become a historic turning point that reshapes the political landscape of the Republic remains to be seen. Yet one truth has become unmistakably clear: when the people begin to raise their own voices, the direction of politics inevitably begins to move toward their lives."

He went on to argue that "China's entire social structure throttles personal freedom, scholarly inquiry, and every possibility for progress." Several panelists stormed out in protest, but Hu Shih continued unfazed.\n\nHe then turned his attention to censorship and the violence employed by warlords and political factions. "What harms a nation is not freedom," he said, "but the maggots in the latrine who parade around under the banner of freedom." The hall fell into a stunned silence.\n\nThe most controversial portion concerned youth and women. Hu Shih asserted that "A half-hungry, half-educated youth is worth a hundred well-fed old men who refuse to learn," calling for full educational and economic access for women and the poor. When reporters later asked whether his proposals were too radical, he replied, "If anyone thinks this is radical, it merely proves how outdated they've become."\n\nHis remarks provoked thunderous applause from reformists and students, while enraging conservative attendees — a clear sign that a political storm is brewing."

Using these accounts, the party leadership is presenting the 'Equal Livelihood Package,' which includes a phased minimum wage, stabilization of food distribution, improved labor protections, and balanced regional development.\n\nThis hearing is not a simple campaign event but a demonstration that the party is directly connecting public testimony to policymaking.

The leadership is presenting a long-term strategy involving territorial restoration, securing railway networks, reorganizing logistics, and reinforcing border defense.\n\nThis event demonstrates that the Nationalist Party views the Northern Expedition not as a mere display of force but as an essential process to restore national legitimacy.

Some hardliners have even begun calling for a re-vote and are mobilizing street protests.\n\nHowever, other parties and most newspapers criticize the Kuomintang for merely disguising its collapsing support base as 'electoral fraud.'

Some lawmakers have gone so far as to argue that 'media bias was the real election fraud' and demanded the creation of a media oversight committee.\n\nMost media outlets have sharply rejected the accusation, countering that the Kuomintang itself avoided interviews and revealed nothing but internal chaos during the election.

They have cited changes in counting personnel, the transport routes of ballot boxes, and the use of temporary polling stations as supposed evidence of tampering.\n\nThe electoral commission has flatly denied all allegations, stating that voting proceeded under identical standards nationwide.

The government immediately condemned the attack as a deliberate act of violence.\n\nSurvivors report that despite the vessel signaling clearly as a relief ship, the KMT artillery crews continued firing. Several shells even landed near lifeboats as people tried to escape the sinking vessel, turning the scene into chaos. Although the Kuomintang claims the incident was an 'accidental misfire,' public opinion—especially in Sichuan—sees it as political retribution and intentional aggression.\n\nThe incident has amplified fears that radical KMT factions, enraged after their electoral defeat, may be shifting toward open armed resistance. Since the Yangtze transport route is the lifeline of Sichuan's recovery, the sinking of this relief vessel has sent shockwaves through the entire Republic."

The region has long hosted Kuomintang-aligned volunteer forces who, though nominally organized for local defense, effectively functioned as an independent military apparatus separate from the provincial government troops.\n\nAs famine worsened, the central and provincial governments began sending relief shipments to Sichuan by river transport. But with political tensions rising during the election, clashes between the provincial government forces and the KMT volunteer units became increasingly frequent. Each side accused the other of interfering in the election, and sporadic skirmishes turned parts of the province into de facto conflict zones.\n\nThe situation escalated dramatically when a government relief boat entering Sichuan waters was shelled by the KMT volunteer forces. They claimed the vessel represented 'external manipulation of the election' and opened fire. The attack shocked the entire region; famine-stricken civilians who awaited the relief reacted with outrage and panic.\n\nFor the central government, this was the final breaking point. The attack on an official relief ship was viewed not merely as a localized clash, but as a direct defiance of state authority and a violent disruption of national humanitarian efforts. As a result, the central government has issued an immediate order mandating the dissolution of all KMT-aligned volunteer forces operating in Sichuan.\n\nThe provincial government troops appear ready to comply, but resistance is brewing among the volunteer commanders, many of whom denounce the order as political persecution. Civilians are deeply divided: some condemn the volunteer forces for attacking relief shipments, while others credit them for defending the region in difficult times. The dissolution order is now positioned to become a defining turning point in Sichuan's deepening crisis, with political repercussions likely to spread far beyond the province."

Several hardliners have already organized protests outside the party headquarters, accusing the government of attempting to forcibly disarm the party.\n\nMilitia commanders across the provinces are also refusing to comply.

Both sides are invoking competing justifications, and the fighting has intensified to the point where heavy weaponry is now being used, dramatically increasing casualties.\n\nReports indicate the destruction of government offices, supply depots, and key bridges.

In particular, the far-right elements strongly reject the leadership's decisions and openly refuse to acknowledge their authority.\n\nThese hardliners accuse the Chiang–Wang bloc of monopolizing every major policy choice, while several provincial branches are beginning to show signs of resisting central control altogether. Meetings frequently descend into shouting and accusations, and some legislators have even received threats, further worsening the atmosphere inside the party.\n\nFor now, the Chiang–Wang alliance remains intact, but the accumulated resentment from other factions has placed the Kuomintang as a whole in a state of deep and growing fracture."

Some provincial branches have declared they will not follow the central leadership's decision at all.

They emphasized that, with the fall of the Constitutional Protection Government, the northwest can no longer remain an isolated warlord domain, and that only the KMT can restore order to a China in turmoil.\n\nHowever, it remains unclear whether this declaration signifies genuine submission.

In many areas, supervisors were not properly deployed, and several polling stations failed to report results for days, sparking nationwide ridicule and suspicion. From the moment the polls closed, the Commission's incompetence became a national controversy, to the point that the government began discussing reforms in haste.\n\nBut the issue did not end with incompetence alone. Among Kuomintang supporters, the belief quickly spread that the Commission's errors were not mere mistakes but deliberate manipulation. When counting delays grew worse in Sichuan and the Jiangnan region, KMT supporters began openly claiming that the election had been rigged in favor of the ruling party. What began as fringe accusations soon became the dominant view among the party's base as the controversy escalated.\n\nSensing this shift, not only hardliners but even moderates within the Kuomintang leadership began to argue that the Commission's comprehensive failures had severely undermined the credibility of the election. Today, the Central Committee issued an official statement declaring that the general election had "lost its fairness due to severe procedural defects and the structural incompetence of the Election Commission." The statement further suggested that intentional interference could not be ruled out, effectively announcing the party's refusal to accept the results.\n\nThe declaration has shaken the political landscape. KMT supporters celebrated the announcement and began preparing large-scale rallies, while the government denounced it as "political agitation," responding with visible irritation. Several provincial governments are monitoring the situation closely and considering security measures, and signs of political maneuvering are emerging within certain parts of the military.\n\nThe Kuomintang's decision is not a simple expression of dissatisfaction. Public anger pushed the leadership into adopting fraud allegations as official party policy, and the controversy surrounding the Election Commission has spiraled far beyond what the government can contain.

Relief operations and the urgent humanitarian crisis consumed all available political focus, forcing the reform to be shelved. Yet the warlord problem remains the fundamental source of instability within the Republic, and without reorganizing the national military structure, no long-term plan can be pursued.\n\nThe reintroduced bill aims to strengthen nationwide conscription and, more critically, to abolish the private armies maintained by the provincial warlords. It is not merely a military reform—it is a central pillar of resolving China's political turmoil. If successful, the central government will finally regain direct control over the military, undermining the warlords' autonomous power.\n\nBut the warlords stand in the way. Pushing the reform aggressively will almost certainly provoke resistance, and several warlords already perceive the bill as a direct threat to their survival. On the other hand, attempting compromise may secure temporary cooperation but risks watering down key measures such as the banning of private armies.\n\nThe government must now decide: accept the risks of confrontation and push the reform with full force, or seek a negotiated approach that preserves stability at the cost of concessions.

He had been monitored closely by the hardline elements of the government.\n\nAccording to the official statement, the Loyalty Forces attempted to arrest him on charges of 'inciting anti-government agitation,' and when he allegedly resisted, an immediate 'on-the-spot judgement' was enforced. However, eyewitnesses present at the scene claim that the journalist was unarmed and offered no meaningful resistance, and that the Loyalty Forces did not follow proper arrest procedures.\n\nThe execution shocked nearby residents, who fled the scene as gunshots rang out. While the government maintains that the action was necessary to preserve public order and prevent a resurgence of civil conflict, the killing of a journalist without trial has already sparked controversy both domestically and abroad.\n\nAt its core, the incident highlights the increasingly aggressive posture of the Loyalty Forces as fear of Kuomintang resurgence continues to shape government policy. Many worry that if the pattern of excessive force remains unchecked, similar tragedies will become more frequent.

The demonstrators had gathered in front of the local administrative office, demanding the release of Kuomintang prisoners and an end to the government's hardline measures. As the crowd grew, some participants marched toward the city center, chanting slogans and waving banners.\n\nLocal police, fearing that the demonstrators might attempt to occupy government buildings, requested immediate reinforcement from the Loyalty Forces. Once deployed, the forces were instructed to 'secure order.' However, when several protesters threw stones and shook the barricades, the commanding officer ordered the use of live ammunition without issuing proper warnings.\n\nThe troops fired directly into the crowd, resulting in over a hundred casualties—both dead and severely injured. The sudden eruption of gunfire triggered widespread panic, with civilians fleeing in terror through the streets. In the aftermath, the square was left scattered with bloodstained pavement, abandoned shoes, and shattered banners.\n\nThe central government has claimed that the casualties were 'an unavoidable consequence of suppressing violent unrest,' but citizens of Xuzhou, along with several regional officials, have expressed outrage over the extreme use of force. The incident stands as a stark symbol of how far the government's anti-Kuomintang campaign has escalated, and it may significantly reshape the nation's political climate."

Streams of displaced persons—war refugees, remnants fleeing former conflict zones, and citizens escaping famine—have crowded the major roads daily. While movement is strictly restricted under martial law, many civilians no longer have intact homes to return to, making compliance nearly impossible.\n\nToday, a horrific incident occurred on a northern Wuhan roadway when government security forces opened live fire on a large refugee column. The guards had ordered the refugees to disperse, claiming they were violating movement restrictions. When some refugees, burdened with the bodies of deceased family members or the bare necessities they refused to abandon, were unable to comply immediately, the commander interpreted it as 'collective defiance and subversive behavior.'\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the guards fired without issuing a final warning. Gunfire echoed across the highway as refugees panicked and scattered in all directions. Multiple accounts describe children trampled in the chaos, elderly civilians collapsing under gunfire while clutching their belongings, and families torn apart in the stampede. Scores of casualties were recorded within minutes.\n\nThe government released an official statement asserting that elements within the column attempted to breach martial law control lines, and that decisive action was necessary to prevent unrest. However, Wuhan residents and local officials have criticized the justification as a thin excuse for state violence born of fear and incompetence. Analysts warn that the growing tension within the Loyalty Forces and security units—combined with the government's fear of Kuomintang remnants—has created a climate where indiscriminate force is becoming normalized.\n\nMany believe the tragedy was not a mere mistake but the natural result of an escalating security doctrine that prioritizes coercion over governance. The Wuhan refugee shooting is expected to send shockwaves through the political landscape, raising deeper questions about the government's legitimacy and its capacity to rule."

With the Election Commission's mismanagement, regional counting delays, and inadequate oversight repeatedly exposed, KMT supporters quickly embraced the belief that the election had been "rigged from the very beginning" and that the government had stolen their victory.\n\nThe party's hardliners seized on this sentiment, declaring that the government had manipulated the election to seize power and calling not merely for political protest but for open armed resistance. The Central Committee initially rejected these claims, but the situation flipped entirely once the party's supporters issued a massive public statement proclaiming that "electoral fraud is equivalent to a declaration of war."\n\nAt dawn today, hardline KMT officers and several senior leaders unilaterally mobilized military units and launched armed action against the government. Declaring a "national revolution against the theft of power," they called for the support of local forces and militia organizations. Alarmingly, this decision was made without the clear approval of the party's moderates and centrists.\n\nThe situation continues to deteriorate. With firefights already erupting and civil war effectively underway, moderates and centrists within the Kuomintang find that they have few choices left. Hardliners are pressuring them openly, while the party's supporters claim that "anyone who hesitates is a traitor." As a result, many moderates and centrists are being forced—willingly or not—into joining the conflict.\n\nThe government has denounced the uprising as an "outright military rebellion" and moved immediately into suppression mode. Yet what began as a dispute over election legitimacy has, in a single night, escalated into military clashes and political collapse, pushing the nation beyond the point where peaceful resolution seems possible.\n\nThe Kuomintang's entry into civil war is no longer a mere political protest—it is a full-scale challenge to the system, justified under the banner of electoral fraud.

They convened representatives from the regions, social sectors, and various political groups for an emergency council, which ultimately agreed to establish an extraordinary cross-faction cabinet: the National Unity Government.\n\nThis new government has begun taking over the essential functions of the state—public security, administrative restoration, food distribution, transport networks, and the coordination of local forces—gradually replacing the paralyzed ministries of the old administration. Many civil servants and local authorities, fearing further disorder, have pledged cooperation, leading observers to note that political authority is steadily shifting toward the Unity Government.\n\nMeanwhile, Kuomintang hardliners denounce the move as an illegitimate seizure of power, and parts of the military remain hesitant, uncertain of which side will prevail. Yet for many citizens, the emergence of a functioning authority—however fragile—is the first sign of stability in weeks of chaos.\n\nWith the old regime and the new emergency cabinet now coexisting in an unprecedented dual structure, China's future hinges on whether the National Unity Government can contain the spreading conflict and restore order."

A few managed to flee beforehand, but many had no chance to react.\n\nThe government claims these detentions are precautionary steps to prevent potential violent unrest, but within the Kuomintang, the situation is widely seen as a deliberate political crackdown. Peking has grown increasingly tense, and with so many major figures detained and unreachable, the party's internal command structure has fallen into disarray.\n\nFailing to relocate to Nanjing in time has come at a harsh price.

Hu Si quietly reviewed the document, then pointed out that the existing doctrine resembled the Kuomintang's ideology far too closely. Concepts such as "loving all things" or "loving the world" were, he argued, far too abstract for a country engulfed in civil war and desperate reconstruction.\n\n"What we need now is not a universal lecture on morality," Hu Si said, "but principles that can actually protect our citizens and keep the country alive."\n\nHe then took a blank sheet of paper and wrote three new phrases:\n\n"Love the People, Love Freedom, Love Our Land."\n\nPlacing the sheet on the table, he continued, "To love the people, to defend freedom, and to care for the land on which we stand—these three are enough.

Nevertheless, the government deployed administrative staff and security forces to stabilize the process and pushed the elections forward.

Now that the national situation has stabilized, there is no longer any need for them to retain their temporary, semi-independent powers. \n\nAdministrators from Jiangnan, Hubei, Shanxi, and other regions have formally notified the central government of their intent to reintegrate, and the Constitutional Protection leadership is moving quickly to incorporate them back into the official administrative framework.

Before the industrial base could recover, vast amounts of newly issued money had already entered circulation.\n\nAs a consequence, inflation had begun even before the civil war. At the time, it was considered manageable, and some believed it could be stabilized through liquidity withdrawal and fiscal adjustments. But once the civil war erupted, the situation changed entirely. Administrative structures faltered, supply chains collapsed, and public confidence in the currency deteriorated sharply across the provinces.\n\nUltimately, the already weakened monetary system could not withstand the shock of war. Prices skyrocketed within mere weeks, and ordinary citizens found even basic necessities increasingly unaffordable. Merchants were forced to adjust prices several times a day, and in some regions, barter trade reappeared as the currency's function deteriorated.\n\nThe government insists this is merely a 'temporary monetary disturbance,' but the reality felt by the population is far graver.

Mere institutional reform is deemed insufficient to shift market perception, prompting the introduction of a new currency design.\n\nThe new design serves as a symbol of monetary reform, clearly demonstrating the state's break with past mismanagement. Through this change, the government aims to rebuild psychological trust in the currency."

This measure is regarded as a cornerstone of institutional support for monetary reform."
