They succeeded in assassinating the prime minister and other key figures in Japan, and their coup was successful when the emperor finally sided with them. \n\nIf maintained in Japan, parliamentary democracy would be completely shut down in the hands of the Kodoha, and Japan would likely become more like a pre-modern feudal state, with all power vested in the emperor. However, given Japan's history, it is unlikely that the emperor will actually wield power in an active manner."
