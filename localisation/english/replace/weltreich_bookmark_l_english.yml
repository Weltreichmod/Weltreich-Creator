Forced to accept humiliating terms — enormous reparations, colonial losses, and the demilitarization of its borders — the nation was fractured between north and south, city and countryside. Scars of war ran deep, and the people fell into despair. Workers and peasants alike rose up for their own causes, plunging politics into chaos and division.\n\nAfter the defeat, political strife intensified between left and right. The split between Pierre Laval and Édouard Herriot gave way to a sweeping victory of the Left Alliance in the general elections, but violent riots, the Bloody Week, and the tragic death of President Paul Deschanel completely shattered the prestige of the Republic. At the height of the turmoil, Marshal Philippe Pétain seized power through a military coup, bringing the Third Republic to its end.\n\nIn 1922, Pétain proclaimed himself §YSupreme Commander§! and founded the §YFrench State§!. Backed by Charles de Gaulle and his Party of Republican Order, he suppressed dissent through the Gendarmerie and Mobile Police. Meanwhile, he pursued rearmament, economic reforms, and an industrial reconstruction policy known as the 'Gamelin Plan,' establishing a new order upon the ruins of defeat.\n\nYet, the dictatorship would not last. The Great Depression and the Stavisky Affair eroded the regime’s authority, and as the Popular and Democratic Unions rose, Jacques Doriot’s Popular Socialist militias marched on Paris. In the winter of 1934, the Marshal’s government finally collapsed. Once again, France stands at a crossroads. Will it choose order or liberty, vengeance or justice?\n\n“Unless we do everything for freedom, we have done nothing at all.” – Maximilien Robespierre§!\n\n§YPaths of the French State§!\n- Jacques Doriot's Popular Socialism\n- Marcel Déat's Neo-Socialism\n- François de La Rocque's National Orderism\n- Charles de Gaulle's Republican Military Government\n- Marcel Bucard's Revanchism Regime\n- Charles Maurras' Integral Nationalism\n- Léon Blum's Social Democracy\n- Paul Reynaud's Liberalism\n- Pierre Monatte's Syndicalism"

Update\n§W--------------§!\n\n£GFX_texticon_bookmark_ITA\n\n\n\n\n§LThe Kingdom of Italy, once a fragile liberal monarchy, collapsed under the weight of its defeat in the Great War. Denied the territories it had been promised and shamed on the world stage, the country was left adrift — its people bitter, its veterans restless, and its institutions crumbling. In the wake of national despair, it was not a politician but a poet who seized the moment.\n\nIn 1922, Gabriele D’Annunzio, famed for his wartime exploits and nationalist rhetoric, led a peaceful yet determined march on Rome. Proclaimed by crowds as the savior of Italy, he dissolved the monarchy and established the Republic of the Italian People: a democratic but conservative regime built upon his vision of national unity, cultural grandeur, and spiritual renewal.\n\nNow, over a decade later, the D’Annunzian Republic stands at a crossroads. The aging "First Citizen" remains the unchallenged heart of the nation, but his time is drawing to a close. Italy remains embittered over the loss of its irredentist claims — South Tyrol, Istria, Dalmatia — and uneasy about Austria’s continued presence across its northeastern border. With Europe once again drifting toward crisis, Italy must soon decide: will it maintain its poetic dream of peace and dignity, or prepare once more for war in pursuit of national redemption?§!"

 BOOKMARK_CANADA_INFO_DELAYED:0 "§YNew Playable Country§!\n\n§LAlthough Canada lost the World War, it did not suffer much damage because it was far from Europe, and was not deeply involved in the war. However, the Great Depression of 1931 destroyed all of Canada's economic foundations. Especially since its suzerain, Great Britain, was also slow to recover, as it lost the World War, making it seem like Canada's economic recovery was so slow that it hardly seemed to take place.\n\nThe Conservative Party successfully used Section 98 of the Criminal Code to stop the expansion of extremist forces, but lost the 1935 general election because it produced little success in overcoming the Great Depression. The coalition is unstable even though the Liberal-CCF-Conservative coalition government was formed as a result of the 1935 general election to keep the Social Credit Party in check.§!\n\n§YPathes of Canada§!§W\n- Stable Coalition\n- Social Credit Party in Power\n- Liberal Party in Power\n- CCF in Power\n- Communist Party of Canada in Power\n- National Unity Party of Canada in Power§!"

Update\n§W--------------§!\n\n£GFX_texticon_bookmark_GER\n\n\n\n\n§LThe German Empire had won the Great War and Germany seemed to be entering a golden age. But in 1931, the Great Depression began to shake things up.\n\nThe Social Democrats, who controlled the parliament at the time, were unable to respond quickly enough to the Great Depression, and the German people began to express their anger at their economically crumbling lives. Not surprisingly, the Social Democrats were defeated in the 1931 general election, and conservative parties came to power. The Kaiser appointed Paul von Hindenburg as the new chancellor, with the will of parliament and the people, and Hindenburg formed the Hindenburg Cabinet, including Franz von Papen and Kurd von Schleicher.\n\nHindenburg's first cabinet, however, was even more incompetent than the Social Democrats, and Hindenburg placed the blame on Papen, forcing him out of the cabinet and forming a new one. Under the second cabinet, which included Alfred Hugenberg as economy minister, Germany showed a visible economic recovery and gained public support.\n\nIn 1934, Hindenburg died of old age while still chancellor. Hindenburg's heir apparent, Schleicher, became the next Chancellor, but he wanted to make the power of the Chancellor more powerful and was preparing for an autocoup after a conflict with the Kaiser. The country is in political turmoil internally, and externally, France and Soviet Russia are just waiting for Germany to fall on their swords of revenge. If we don't sort out the internal and external chaos, we may fall apart.\n\n“We Germans fear God and but nothing else in the world.” - Otto von Bismark§!"

Update\n§W--------------§!\n\n£GFX_texticon_bookmark_AUH\n\n\n\n\n§LAs revenge for Franz Ferdinand sounded the victory bell, Austria-Hungary desperately sought to prop up the disintegrating land. With post-war panic gripping the country and Slavic peoples agitated by the wages of war, Kaiser Karl was determined. In 1921, the Reichsrat did just that, ushering in an era of reform.\n\nThe Vienna Reichsrat continued its successful reforms, but the Pannonian Steppe was not about to let its interests be violated. The Croatian crisis of 1927 brought down Ignaz Seipel's cabinet and plunged the empire into the horrors of war, but it also proved that Hungary's ethnic policies were ineffective. The Magyars antagonized Vienna but feared the consequences, even if they were extreme.\n\nIn 1931, the century of peace ended with the collapse of Austria's largest bank, the Creditanstalt. Wilhelm Miklas, a prominent member of the Christian Social Party, was able to hold on to his chancellorship, preventing the Great Depression from choking off the imperial economy, but no one knew that Austria's era was over.\n\nBy 1936, the new Vienna regime was faltering. Metternich's diplomatic skills are gone, relations with Germany remain unstable, and Otto Bauer's cabinet is barely surviving the aftermath of the Great Depression, which has been raging for years. With an Ausgleich with Hungary, which distrusts Vienna, looming on the horizon, Emperor Karl's government faces the daunting task of keeping the Empire alive...\n\n“All the world is subject to Austria.”§!"

My heart grew emptier, wandering like the white clouds drifting between mountain ridges, like the evening wind that sweeps across the boundless plains, with no place to return to."\n\nOn the streets of Beijing, a man marvels at the torch of democracy-an unparalleled liberal democratic state in the East. Amid the glittering lights and splendor of the city, no different from those of any Western metropolis, many scholars and seekers find themselves captivated. Yet, they remain unaware of the Zhongqing Party deputies shouting across the chamber, the Progressive Party legislators hurling chairs, the Speaker slamming the gavel while shouting to restore order, or the Kuomintang militias brandishing clubs at polling stations to intimidate voters. They do not hear the cries of commoners lamenting the rising cost of living, nor do they see the factories sealed shut and blanketed in dust.\n\nWith the peaceful end of Yuan Shikai's term, the Republic has gradually begun laying its foundations. Upon the pillars erected by Song Jiaoren, Cao Kun laid his roof, and thus the Republic became the sole state in the East to realize a government of the people. Yet now, it wanders adrift, as though lost in an endless wilderness. The March 3rd Uprising, which erupted in defiance of Sun Yat-sen's autocratic leadership, and his sudden death thereafter, have left the Kuomintang military-now functioning as a de facto warlord faction-unchecked in its abuses. Meanwhile, provincial governments grow ever bolder in their calls for autonomy, and mutual fearmongering in electoral campaigns continues to threaten the dream of democracy and the rule of law. How much longer must China roam this vast wilderness before it can truly become the light of the East?"
