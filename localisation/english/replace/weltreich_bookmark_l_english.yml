It is, after all, the republicans and monarchists who got France into this mess.\n\nAs such, by late 1919, the protests turned into revolts, and the revolts, soon enough, into a revolution, of many colours. In Paris, for a long time, the legacy of the Commune of 1871 reigned supreme, whilst in the south the Occitanese declared an independent Republic, as did the Bretons, whilst the monarchists lost relevance. However, fate stood with neither of these forces alone. The forces of Conservatives, liberals, Communards and independists where thrown into utter chaos, when in 1921, the German Forces were preparing to cross over the border, to take advantage of France and its people, once more.\n\nOut of this need of compromise arose the National-Syndicalists, who merged the political spectrum of France, to unite all forces against what was the true enemy, the Germans.  Germany, along with all of Mitteleuropa also embargoed France, forcing it to make political and diplomatic ties with Italy. Valois and his National Syndicalists enactes a state-cooperative based economy, and a political rejuvenation not of a french ethnicity but of a French State, united by its differences in all regions. By 1929, France was in the economic state they were in early 1914, strong and proud of their nation, and ready to build up a military. Will the French succeed? Or will the Empire strike them down decisively? Only time can tell, but...\n\n“Unless you do everything for liberty, you have done nothing. There are no two ways of being free: one must be entirely free, or become a slave once more.” -Maximilien Robespierre§!"

Update\n§W--------------§!\n\n£GFX_texticon_bookmark_SOV\n\n\n\n\n§LRussia, currently, is as once Rosa Luxemburg said "between socialism and barbarism". The Kaiser's hegemony of Europe had beaten down any sort of hope for the hope of international revolution to be applicable in these dire times. For over a decade, it has been faced, on one hand with a severe lack of prepared defenses, and on the other hand with a lack of competent management for resources.\n\nAfter Lenin's Retirement in late 1922, Lev Kamenev came to control and unite the factions within the soviets of Russia. The Civil War was drawing to an end, yet even so, after compromises and compromises, distinct factions remained, and resistance formed. Out of a desperate struggle for a stable Soviet Republic, the Kamenev Doctrine was passed,  which for a moment at least stopped the factionalist infighting within the Bolsheviks, or as they were called now, the Communist Labour Party of Russia. Figures within the civil war, most importantly leaders of regional soviets and military leaders, had their own "ideas" for how the Soviets of Russia should proceed. But that now no longer matters.\n\nA shot rung across the world. Kamenev is at death's door. How does Russia survive this hell? Will the social-chauvinists be defeated? Will this experiment last even one more year? That is to be seen, because...\n\n"Either the international revolution comes to our assistance, and in that case our victory will be fully assured, or we shall do our modest revolutionary work in the conviction that even in the event of defeat we shall have served the cause of the revolution and that our experience will benefit other revolutions." -V.I.

With this, Victor Emmanuel III had rejected the italian values, and would soon face his fate with his abdication in favour of an unstable democracy, bringing turmoil to the streets of italy, ravaging what is left of the country after the Treaty of Trentino - the most shameful moment in italian history, right after the fall or Rome.\n\nBut the italians couldn't let this just happen, the will for revenge had spread faster than a plague, as Lombardy-Venetia was ripped apart from their italian brothers, all unredeemed italian lands were now out of reach, so the strongest and most willing italians had formed the fascists.\n\n"A single twig breaks, but the bundle of twigs is strong." - Tecumseh\n\nUnder the leadership of D'annunzio, the bundle had formed and would expand it's influence, and with the March on Rome, the fascists would instate total power, bringing an end to the unstable republic, but stability would not reign long, as D'annunzio suffered through multiple strokes, and his health is declining rapidly, and a struggle between Modernity and Tradition is on the rise -  ready to take down the new italy that the fascists are building from the ashes.\n\n"The Fascist accepts and loves life; he rejects and despises suicide as cowardly. Life as he understands it means duty, elevation, conquest; life must be lofty and full, it must be lived for oneself but above all for others, both near bye and far off, present and future." - B.

However, the Great Depression of 1929 destroyed all of Canada's economic foundations. Especially since its suzerain, Great Britain, was also slow to recover, as it lost the World War, making it seem like Canada's economic recovery was so slow that it hardly seemed to take place.\n\nThe Conservative Party successfully used Section 98 of the Criminal Code to stop the expansion of extremist forces, but lost the 1935 general election because it produced little success in overcoming the Great Depression. The coalition is unstable even though the Liberal-CCF-Conservative coalition government was formed as a result of the 1935 general election to keep the Social Credit Party in check.§!\n\n§YPathes of Canada§!§W\n- Stable Coalition\n- Social Credit Party in Power\n- Liberal Party in Power\n- CCF in Power\n- Communist Party of Canada in Power\n- National Unity Party of Canada in Power§!"

Once the breadbasket of the Reich, now a nation teetering on collapse, the Grand Duchy exists only as long as Berlin wills it. Vasyl von Habsburg, the so-called Grand Duke, was placed upon his throne by German bayonets in 1920, a puppet raised to replace the inconveniently independent Pavlo Skoropadskyi. His reign, once gilded with promises of prosperity and unity, is now defined by betrayal and suffering.\n\nThe Holodomor of 1932 shattered any illusions of stability. As millions perished, the Grand Duke stood idle, powerless against the will of his masters. In the streets, resentment festers—against the Germans who steal Ukraine’s grain, against the Habsburg who let them, and against the hollow state that serves only foreign interests. The once-mighty Sich Riflemen, once the backbone of Ukraine’s army, have been cast aside, their loyalty turned to bitterness. Now, the Grand Duchy stands as a house of cards, shaking in the wind.\n\nAny misstep by Vasyl could send it all crashing down."
