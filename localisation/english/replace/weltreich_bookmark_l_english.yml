It is, after all, the republicans and monarchists who got France into this mess.\n\nAs such, by late 1919, the protests turned into revolts, and the revolts, soon enough, into a revolution, of many colours. In Paris, for a long time, the legacy of the Commune of 1871 reigned supreme, whilst in the south the Occitanese declared an independent Republic, as did the Bretons, whilst the monarchists lost relevance. However, fate stood with neither of these forces alone. The forces of Conservatives, liberals, Communards and independists where thrown into utter chaos, when in 1921, the German Forces were preparing to cross over the border, to take advantage of France and its people, once more.\n\nOut of this need of compromise arose the National-Syndicalists, who merged the political spectrum of France, to unite all forces against what was the true enemy, the Germans.  Germany, along with all of Mitteleuropa also embargoed France, forcing it to make political and diplomatic ties with Italy. Valois and his National Syndicalists enactes a state-cooperative based economy, and a political rejuvenation not of a french ethnicity but of a French State, united by its differences in all regions. By 1929, France was in the economic state they were in early 1914, strong and proud of their nation, and ready to build up a military. Will the French succeed? Or will the Empire strike them down decisively? Only time can tell, but...\n\n“Unless you do everything for liberty, you have done nothing.

The Kaiser's hegemony of Europe had beaten down any sort of hope for the hope of international revolution to be applicable in these dire times. For over a decade, it has been faced, on one hand with a severe lack of prepared defenses, and on the other hand with a lack of competent management for resources.\n\nAfter Lenin's Retirement in late 1922, Lev Kamenev came to control and unite the factions within the soviets of Russia. The Civil War was drawing to an end, yet even so, after compromises and compromises, distinct factions remained, and resistance formed. Out of a desperate struggle for a stable Soviet Republic, the Kamenev Doctrine was passed,  which for a moment at least stopped the factionalist infighting within the Bolsheviks, or as they were called now, the Communist Labour Party of Russia. Figures within the civil war, most importantly leaders of regional soviets and military leaders, had their own "ideas" for how the Soviets of Russia should proceed. But that now no longer matters.\n\nA shot rung across the world. Kamenev is at death's door. How does Russia survive this hell? Will the social-chauvinists be defeated? Will this experiment last even one more year? That is to be seen, because...\n\n"Either the international revolution comes to our assistance, and in that case our victory will be fully assured, or we shall do our modest revolutionary work in the conviction that even in the event of defeat we shall have served the cause of the revolution and that our experience will benefit other revolutions." -V.I.

Update\n§W--------------§!\n\n£GFX_texticon_bookmark_ITA\n\n\n\n\n§LThe Kingdom of Italy, once a fragile liberal monarchy, collapsed under the weight of its defeat in the Great War. Denied the territories it had been promised and shamed on the world stage, the country was left adrift — its people bitter, its veterans restless, and its institutions crumbling. In the wake of national despair, it was not a politician but a poet who seized the moment.\n\nIn 1922, Gabriele D’Annunzio, famed for his wartime exploits and nationalist rhetoric, led a peaceful yet determined march on Rome. Proclaimed by crowds as the savior of Italy, he dissolved the monarchy and established the Republic of the Italian People: a democratic but conservative regime built upon his vision of national unity, cultural grandeur, and spiritual renewal.\n\nNow, over a decade later, the D’Annunzian Republic stands at a crossroads. The aging "First Citizen" remains the unchallenged heart of the nation, but his time is drawing to a close. Italy remains embittered over the loss of its irredentist claims — South Tyrol, Istria, Dalmatia — and uneasy about Austria’s continued presence across its northeastern border. With Europe once again drifting toward crisis, Italy must soon decide: will it maintain its poetic dream of peace and dignity, or prepare once more for war in pursuit of national redemption?§!"

However, the Great Depression of 1931 destroyed all of Canada's economic foundations. Especially since its suzerain, Great Britain, was also slow to recover, as it lost the World War, making it seem like Canada's economic recovery was so slow that it hardly seemed to take place.\n\nThe Conservative Party successfully used Section 98 of the Criminal Code to stop the expansion of extremist forces, but lost the 1935 general election because it produced little success in overcoming the Great Depression. The coalition is unstable even though the Liberal-CCF-Conservative coalition government was formed as a result of the 1935 general election to keep the Social Credit Party in check.§!\n\n§YPathes of Canada§!§W\n- Stable Coalition\n- Social Credit Party in Power\n- Liberal Party in Power\n- CCF in Power\n- Communist Party of Canada in Power\n- National Unity Party of Canada in Power§!"

However, the Russian Republic was highly unstable, which led to the October Revolution. After a long civil war, the civil war ended in a Bolshevik victory, and White Russia collapsed.\n\nBut still, a number of White Army generals remained, and they formed organizations in various parts of the country and abroad with the goal of destroying Soviet Russia. White Army general Pyotr Brangel's Russian All-Military Union was one of the largest of these organizations. The Russian All-Military Union went through several commanders, lurking in the shadows, waiting for its chance.\n\nThen World War II broke out, and Soviet Russia entered the war.

But in 1931, the Great Depression began to shake things up.\n\nThe Social Democrats, who controlled the parliament at the time, were unable to respond quickly enough to the Great Depression, and the German people began to express their anger at their economically crumbling lives. Not surprisingly, the Social Democrats were defeated in the 1931 general election, and conservative parties came to power. The Kaiser appointed Paul von Hindenburg as the new chancellor, with the will of parliament and the people, and Hindenburg formed the Hindenburg Cabinet, including Franz von Papen and Kurd von Schleicher.\n\nHindenburg's first cabinet, however, was even more incompetent than the Social Democrats, and Hindenburg placed the blame on Papen, forcing him out of the cabinet and forming a new one. Under the second cabinet, which included Alfred Hugenberg as economy minister, Germany showed a visible economic recovery and gained public support.\n\nIn 1934, Hindenburg died of old age while still chancellor. Hindenburg's heir apparent, Schleicher, became the next Chancellor, but he wanted to make the power of the Chancellor more powerful and was preparing for an autocoup after a conflict with the Kaiser. The country is in political turmoil internally, and externally, France and Soviet Russia are just waiting for Germany to fall on their swords of revenge. If we don't sort out the internal and external chaos, we may fall apart.\n\n“We Germans fear God and but nothing else in the world.” - Otto von Bismark§!"

Update\n§W--------------§!\n\n£GFX_texticon_bookmark_AUH\n\n\n\n\n§LAs revenge for Franz Ferdinand sounded the victory bell, Austria-Hungary desperately sought to prop up the disintegrating land. With post-war panic gripping the country and Slavic peoples agitated by the wages of war, Kaiser Karl was determined. In 1921, the Reichsrat did just that, ushering in an era of reform.\n\nThe Vienna Reichsrat continued its successful reforms, but the Pannonian Steppe was not about to let its interests be violated. The Croatian crisis of 1927 brought down Ignaz Seipel's cabinet and plunged the empire into the horrors of war, but it also proved that Hungary's ethnic policies were ineffective. The Magyars antagonized Vienna but feared the consequences, even if they were extreme.\n\nIn 1931, the century of peace ended with the collapse of Austria's largest bank, the Creditanstalt. Wilhelm Miklas, a prominent member of the Christian Social Party, was able to hold on to his chancellorship, preventing the Great Depression from choking off the imperial economy, but no one knew that Austria's era was over.\n\nBy 1936, the new Vienna regime was faltering. Metternich's diplomatic skills are gone, relations with Germany remain unstable, and Otto Bauer's cabinet is barely surviving the aftermath of the Great Depression, which has been raging for years. With an Ausgleich with Hungary, which distrusts Vienna, looming on the horizon, Emperor Karl's government faces the daunting task of keeping the Empire alive...\n\n“All the world is subject to Austria.”§!"
