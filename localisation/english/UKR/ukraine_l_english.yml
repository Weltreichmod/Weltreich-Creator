 ukraine.1.t:0 "A Nation on the Brink"
 ukraine.1.d:0 "The streets of Kyiv are quieter than they once were. The cafés where poets once debated the future of Ukraine now host only hushed conversations, as wary eyes glance over shoulders for informants. The air is thick with resentment, a bitterness that has festered since the Holodomor stole the lives of millions. In the countryside, farmers hoard what little grain they can, unwilling to feed a system that abandoned them to famine. The once-proud Sich Riflemen, sidelined and humiliated, whisper of betrayal.\n\nVasyl von Habsburg sits in his gilded palace, a king in name but a prisoner in practice. His word carries no weight without Berlin’s blessing, and the German settlers—planted across the land like weeds—tighten their grip on the countryside. Ukrainian aristocrats and bureaucrats, once willing collaborators, now find themselves outnumbered in their own government as German administrators oversee every aspect of the state. Germany ensures that the Grand Duchy remains the breadbasket of the Reich, draining its fields to keep Germany fed, while its people grow ever more bitter and restless.\n\nEverywhere, resentment simmers beneath the surface. The veterans of the Sich Riflemen, cast aside by a state that no longer needs them, find themselves aimless, their loyalty fraying with each passing year. Nationalist agitators, though hunted by the secret police, speak of the Grand Duke as a traitor, a Habsburg puppet ruling at the whim of Berlin. In the villages, priests whisper of divine retribution, while in the cities, factory workers seethe under German overseers. The army, bloated with German officers and plagued by internal divisions, is less a force of defense and more an enforcer of occupation.\n\nThe Grand Duchy stands like a house of cards, fragile and swaying. How much longer can this last?"

 ukraine.2.t:0 "The Boy and the Empty Field"
 ukraine.2.d:0 "The land was dead. The great fields of golden wheat that once danced in the wind had long been harvested, not by the hands of the people who lived there, but by the German landlords who now owned it. What little remained was locked away in grain silos, guarded by men who spoke a foreign tongue. The village had once been full of laughter—his mother’s voice, his father’s stories, the warmth of the hearth. Now, there was only silence, and the boy hated it.\n\nHe knelt by the roadside, staring at the vast emptiness where his home had stood before the famine took everything. His mother had begged the landlords for just a handful of grain, enough to keep them alive, but they laughed in her face. Days later, she was gone, her body left in a shallow grave dug by trembling hands. The boy remembered the hunger, the gnawing pain in his belly, the way his father stopped speaking, his eyes dull and empty. He had left one night and never returned. The boy didn’t ask where he went. He already knew.\n\nThe Germans had taken their land. Vasyl von Habsburg had let them. The boy had never seen the Grand Duke, but he knew his name, spat out in curses by those who had survived. He had heard the whispers in the village, the muttered prayers that God would strike down the foreign king and his masters in Berlin. But God had been silent, just like Vasyl had been when his people starved. Just like Vasyl would be when the next famine came.\n\nA carriage passed by on the road, its occupants draped in fine Austrian silks, their German guards riding alongside. The boy’s fists clenched. The people in the village said that one day, Ukraine would be free—that the Habsburgs and their German lords would pay for what they had done. The boy did not know if that was true, but he knew one thing: when that day came, he would be there."

 ukraine.3.t:0 "The Weight of Guilt"
 ukraine.3.d:0 "The soft creak of the door roused Vasyl from his sleep. His servants entered in practiced silence, setting down his breakfast on the polished oak table beside him. He barely stirred as they moved about, their whispers low and careful. This was routine—another morning in his golden cage.\n\nWith a weary sigh, he sat up and glanced at his meal. Bread. Freshly made, warm, fragrant. Ukrainian grain, kneaded into perfection by the hands of his cooks. His fingers traced the crust absentmindedly, but his mind was already elsewhere.\n\nHe saw the streets outside the palace gates—hollowed faces, sunken eyes, hands trembling from hunger. He had walked among them once, disguised in a simple coat, watching as they begged for crumbs while German guards patrolled with full bellies. He had seen mothers clutch their lifeless children, their bodies wasted away to nothing, as the grain silos stood full, their contents bound for Berlin. And he had done nothing.\n\nHis chest tightened as another memory surfaced—1920, the coup. The day he had been chosen to rule. Pavlo Skoropadskyi, once the Hetman of Ukraine, dismissed like an unruly servant. The Germans had needed a puppet, someone with royal blood but without real power. He had accepted, thinking he could save Ukraine from the shadows. But all he had become was a figurehead, an ornament atop a nation ruled by foreign landlords and bureaucrats.\n\nHis grip on the bread tightened. The simple loaf in his hands felt heavier than gold. It was stolen, just like everything else. A gift of luxury built on the bones of his starving people. His stomach churned. He could not eat this. He would not.\n\nWith a sudden motion, he tossed the bread onto the floor. His dog perked up, eagerly devouring the meal his master refused. Vasyl exhaled slowly, pressing his fingers to his temple. The guilt was unbearable, but there was no time to dwell. He had meetings to attend, papers to sign, and decrees to rubber-stamp.\n\nHe stood, allowing the servants to dress him in regal finery. Only a few minutes had passed since he awoke, but it felt as though he had relived years. The past clung to him like a shadow, one he could never escape. But escape was never an option. He took a deep breath, straightened his posture, and stepped toward the door.\n\nIt was time to play his part."

UKR_Another_Day_in_Mariinsky_Palace_desc:0 "The mornings begin the same. A quiet knock, the shuffle of servants, the scent of fresh bread—Ukrainian grain, stolen from Ukrainian hands. Vasyl von Habsburg does not eat. He dresses in the finery of a ruler who rules nothing and steps into the halls of Mariinsky Palace, where another day of empty routine awaits. His schedule is dictated before he wakes: meetings with German administrators who speak of quotas and exports as if he were not there, audiences with Ukrainian officials whose loyalty is as thin as the paper their grievances are written on. Reports from the countryside—whispers of unrest, starvation, and discontent—pass through his hands before being discarded. The Reich expects him to smile, nod, and sign. And he does.\n\nHe walks the same gilded corridors he has walked for sixteen years, drowning in ceremony and false authority. Letters arrive, begging for relief from those who still believe he has the power to give it. He reads them, then watches as they are tossed aside. The Grand Duchy is a house of cards, and Vasyl is its prisoner, bound to his hollow duties by chains of silk and gold. Evening falls, and he returns to his chambers. He stares at his untouched meal, his stomach empty, his guilt unbearable. When he does eat, he cannot keep it down—his body rejecting the stolen grain as violently as his conscience does. And as he closes his eyes, he wonders—not for the first time—if tomorrow will be any different. He already knows the answer."
