 RUS_influence_of_germany_gui_text:0 "We are fighting in the noble cause of liberating all the people of Russia from the tyranny of the Bolsheviks, but in practice we are under the absolute influence of Germany. We do not have a single factory or government building, and it is difficult for us to do anything without German support. If we are too much under German influence, we will remain their puppets; if not, they will cut off all aid to us."
