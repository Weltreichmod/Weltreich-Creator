 france.1.d:0 "Yesterday morning, French troops marched Champagne and other parts of northeastern France, insisting on the destruction of the Frankfurt Treaty.\n\nGermany's Foreign Ministry has formally protested against France, which has brought the world's attention to Europe.  As a result, the Treaty of Frankfurt was completely destroyed due to this French Republic's declaration of rearmament.\n\nWith this, France is completely out of the shadow of World War I and their anti-German moves are likely to become more active, and France is likely to rearm without any restrictions."

 france.4.t:0 "Catalonia Becomes French Territory"
 france.4.d:0 "There was shocking news this morning. The Spanish government agreed to hand over Catalonia to the French government without any conditions. The Spanish government appears to have succumbed to the military pressure of the past military pressure. Catalonia had long been under the influence of Spain and was briefly occupied by France during the Napoleonic Wars. Under the pretext of this, the French government demanded Catalonia, and Spain, which is experiencing great internal chaos, transferred the territory to France without much resistance."
 france.4.a:0 "Well... It may be the beginning of a terrible thing to come."
 france.5.t:0 "They choose war."
 france.5.d:0 "Eventually, the Spanish government refused to give us Catalonia and chose war. Well, Let's step on it very thoroughly."

 france.6.t:0 "Franco-British Alliance"
 france.6.d:0 "A military alliance between France and Britain was established this morning. It seems obvious that the alliance between the two countries will have a lot of influence on the international situation going forward. In particular, the German government seems to regard the alliance as an alliance to fight against Germany. During World War I, the two formed an alliance against Germany, and the re-established alliance is very stimulating for Germany. Many experts also see it as an alliance against Germany, and this massive event may shake things up in Europe."

 france.10.t:0 "Franco-Italian Alliance"
 france.10.d:0 "This morning, the French-Italian alliance was formed. The two countries share the experience of being defeated disastrously by Germany as Entente during the Great War. The fact that these three countries are again allied means only one thing."

 france.15.t:0 "Southern Uprising"
 france.15.d:0 "Georges Valois, whose whereabouts were unknown, rose, criticizing the current regime, mainly in the southern part of the country. They are the only ones claiming to be legitimate government, and the democrats in Paris accuse them of being traitors."

 france.16.t:0 "French Civil War"
 france.16.d:0 "After weeks of tension, France broke out into a civil war divided into north and south. The world is paying attention to who can be the winner of the civil war, between democrats-led Northern France and fascist-led Southern France. The news of France's civil war may be good news for Germany in the east. Because it can reduce one of their enemies."

 france.25.t:0 "Italy's alliance with France"
 france.25.d:0 "Yesterday morning, the Italian government declared an alliance with France.

 france.32.a:0 "Hurrah!"
 france.33.t:0 "France refused"
 france.33.d:0 "France responded lukewarmly to our proposal. They didn't seem to want to join us, and we might have to go our own way."
 france.33.a:0 "Damn it."
 france.34.t:0 "French rejection about the alliance"

 france.46.a:0 "Let's start reconstitution"
 france.47.t:0 "Defense of France"
 france.47.d:0 "The German occupation of Paris shocked many French people, but the soldiers and people of France were not deterred by it. They all remembered the humiliation of Franco-Prussia, and they remembered the humiliation of the last Great War. They could not be defeated again. No matter how hopeless the situation, France would defeat Germany with indomitable will.\n\nThe French government set up a provisional government in Bordeaux, reminding the people that the fall of Paris would in no way mean the end of France.

A breathtaking silence followed for a moment, and at the end of it [FRA.GetLeader] finally opened her mouth.\n"Ladies, in recent months we have had one serious problem, starting with the Treaty of Frankfurt. Alsace-Loren was a French territory. In addition, Nancy was the rightful territory of our French back in recent decades. All the cultural development in the region was that of the French.\nI will enter this war as a nationalist and a French politician. People, I don't think it's right to give in to an oppressor named Germany. As the most French, it is our destiny to fight against the tyranny of the evil Germanic people.\nThose who wish to reject this national mission will disappear in some way. Remember, for a traitor, death is the only thing.\nThe most noble nation, the French, may you win!\n Vive la!""

 france_wr.1.t:0 "Legislative Proposal Announced"
 france_wr.1.d:0 "Within the All-French Popular Union Party, both Jacques Doriot and Marcel Déat have submitted legislative proposals reflecting sharply opposing visions for national governance. With internal leadership tensions now visible, these proposals are seen as more than just policy suggestions—they represent a deeper political confrontation.\n\nPrime Minister Déat has introduced a centralized economic plan centered on industrial restructuring and state-directed production, while President Doriot has advocated for a decentralized system based on workers' self-management and cooperative networks. Both sides are appealing to popular support, but factional tensions within the party continue to intensify.\n\nThese bills are expected to be submitted to the legislature shortly and will undergo formal deliberation. The outcomes will likely shape not only the internal balance of power within the National Union but also the future of France's economic and social policy.\n\nThe government has announced that it will handle this matter with political neutrality and in accordance with procedure. Meanwhile, the public watches closely, hoping the clash will produce constructive competition rather than deeper division."
 france_wr.1.a:0 "Roll the dice."
 france_wr.2.t:0 "Industrial Syndicate Act Introduced"
 france_wr.2.d:0 "The 'Industrial Syndicate Act' has been submitted to the legislature. This bill proposes the establishment of tripartite consultative bodies—composed of workers, employers, and the state—within key sectors such as heavy industry, railways, and communications. These bodies would be tasked with coordinating wages, production planning, and employment policies, thereby institutionalizing a corporatist framework.\n\nPresident Doriot strongly supports the bill, calling it a pragmatic solution that promotes popular participation while maintaining state authority and resolving industrial conflicts. In contrast, Prime Minister Déat criticizes the proposal for undermining the coherence of national planning and creating what he views as an inefficient system of compromise.\n\nWith both sides firmly entrenched, the outcome of this bill may prove to be a decisive turning point in determining whether Doriot’s corporatist line gains the upper hand."
 france_wr.2.a:0 "Corporatism brings order and unity."  # Doriot's path
 france_wr.2.b:0 "The state must command directly."      # Déat's path
 france_wr.3.t:0 "National Planning Committee Act Introduced"
 france_wr.3.d:0 "The National Assembly of France has received the submission of the 'National Planning Committee Act.' This bill proposes the establishment of a powerful central committee under the authority of the state, tasked with overseeing national production targets, distribution, pricing, and capital flows. The proposed committee is structured as a closed, technocratic body and is regarded as a key instrument in implementing a total planned economy.\n\nPrime Minister Déat has voiced strong support for the bill, describing it as a turning point that eliminates capitalist autonomy and outdated interest group interference, while ushering in a regime of scientific and rational control. In contrast, President Doriot has criticized the proposal as a form of elite rule that disregards the will of the people, warning that such bureaucratic centralization deepens the disconnect between the state and the masses.\n\nTechnocratic totalitarianism or popular pragmatism—this debate reaches beyond administrative structure and touches on the very philosophical foundations of national governance."
 france_wr.3.a:0 "Without planning, there is no order."         # Déat's path
 france_wr.3.b:0 "A plan without the people is just dictatorship." # Doriot's path
 france_wr.4.t:0 "National Labor Service Act Introduced"
 france_wr.4.d:0 "The 'National Labor Service Act' has been submitted to the legislature. This bill seeks to introduce a mandatory labor service program for the youth of France, requiring a fixed period of industrial training, civic education, and communal living. Its stated goal is to foster national unity and instill a disciplined work ethic among the next generation.\n\nPresident Doriot has praised the initiative as a 'social military academy' capable of forging new citizens, describing it as a practical measure for unifying the youth and rebuilding the nation. Prime Minister Déat has refrained from openly opposing the bill, but close associates have conveyed his reservations—namely, that the politicization and formalization of labor could undermine its actual effectiveness.\n\nMore than an ideological clash, the bill has captured public attention for its symbolic and pragmatic implications. It may well serve as a litmus test for the expanding appeal of Doriot’s brand of nationalist statism."

 france_wr.5.t:0 "Limited Cooperative Autonomy Act Introduced"
 france_wr.5.d:0 "The 'Limited Cooperative Autonomy Act' has been brought before the legislature. The bill would allow, under specific conditions, the creation of autonomous cooperatives at the local and sectoral levels, granting them partial self-governance and tax incentives. However, oversight authority would remain with the state, and the nature and scope of cooperatives would still be coordinated by central planners.\n\nPresident Doriot has expressed his support, calling the bill a framework for 'stable autonomy' that could contribute to social cohesion and regional economic recovery. He emphasized the need to balance popular participation with sufficient oversight to avoid disorder. In contrast, Prime Minister Déat has firmly opposed the bill, arguing that the decentralization of cooperatives threatens the coherence of production planning and risks degenerating into unscientific, sentimental localism.\n\nThis legislation has emerged as a clear reflection of the contrasting visions between the two leaders: integration through regulated freedom, or the slippery slope toward fragmentation."
 france_wr.5.a:0 "The people must move within the bounds of control."   # Doriot's path

 france_wr.6.t:0 "Technocratic Certification Act Introduced"
 france_wr.6.d:0 "The 'Technocratic Certification Act' has been submitted to the legislature. The bill proposes to reform the appointment process for senior economic and industrial administrators by replacing political selection with a qualification-based system relying on exams and recommendations. Its stated intent is to institutionalize the role of expert cadres and guide national governance through technical competence rather than ideological allegiance.\n\nPrime Minister Déat has hailed the bill as a 'cornerstone of rational governance,' calling it a chance to build a control system grounded not in political emotion but in science and reason. President Doriot, however, responded sharply: “We will not let this nation be ruled by tests and resumes,” warning that the bill risks sidelining the popular will in favor of a rule by specialists.\n\nThe debate surrounding this legislation reveals a deeper conflict between the efficiency of elite rule and the legitimacy of mass representation—one that may determine the very foundation of France’s future governance."
 france_wr.6.a:0 "Competence is the foundation of legitimacy."         # Déat's path

 france_wr.7.t:0 "Public Assembly Reorganization Act Introduced"
 france_wr.7.d:0 "The 'Public Assembly Reorganization Act' proposes the creation of a new advisory body—referred to as the Public Assembly—composed of representatives from industrial syndicates, technical professions, and labor organizations, existing alongside the current legislature. While the proposed body would lack formal legislative authority, it would hold informal deliberative powers over major policy matters.\n\nPresident Doriot has expressed support for the initiative, describing it as a mediating structure that could bridge trust between the people and the state. He argues that institutionalized participation can help consolidate regime legitimacy and absorb popular sentiment. In contrast, Prime Minister Déat has strongly opposed the bill, asserting that such corporatized intermediaries threaten the unity and efficiency of a planned economy. “The state,” he reiterated, “must speak with a single voice.”\n\nThe bill poses a deeper question: should the relationship between the state and the people be formalized through structured consultation, or streamlined into strict hierarchy? Once again, the ideological rift between two competing visions of authoritarianism is laid bare."
 france_wr.7.a:0 "A leader must hear the voice of the people."         # Doriot's limited support

 france_wr.8.d_1:0 "The legislative review of six major bills in the National Assembly of France has concluded. As a result, President Jacques Doriot’s platform has secured the upper hand in more than four of the proposals, solidifying his influence within the chamber.\n\nDoriot proposed a decentralized economic structure based on worker self-management and cooperative participation, aiming to promote social cohesion through practical corporatism and mass engagement. In contrast, Prime Minister Marcel Déat advocated a centrally planned economy rooted in industrial reorganization and state-directed production, but his vision was criticized as overly ideological and bureaucratic, weakening his position.\n\nThe French state will now be reorganized under Doriot’s populist model of 'integration through order.'"
 france_wr.8.d_2:0 "The legislative review of six major bills in the National Assembly of France has concluded. As a result, more than four proposals aligned with Marcel Déat’s platform have prevailed, marking a clear endorsement of his centralized economic doctrine.\n\nDéat sought to establish a rational and scientific system of governance through full state control over production, distribution, and industrial organization, led by a technocratic elite. President Doriot, on the other hand, promoted corporatist solutions focused on cooperative autonomy and popular participation, but failed to garner support due to concerns over weak coordination and lack of structural coherence.\n\nFrance’s future policies will now be shaped by Déat’s model of 'rational totalitarianism,' underpinned by centralized authority and technocratic planning."
 france_wr.8.d_3:0 "The legislative review of France’s six key bills has ended in a deadlock, with neither side able to secure a majority. President Jacques Doriot and Prime Minister Marcel Déat each championed opposing visions for the nation’s future, but failed to gain decisive support from the Assembly.\n\nDoriot proposed a corporatist framework combining centralized planning with mass mobilization, while Déat advocated for a technocratic planned economy and decentralized cooperative structures. But as tensions deepened between the two camps, neither side was able to consolidate enough legislative dominance.\n\nFrance now enters a period of political paralysis, trapped between a fragmented parliament and an unresolved contest for power. A new balance must be found."

 france_wr.9.t:0 "Unity Through Order"
 france_wr.9.d:0 "Chaos, incompetence, and repeated crises have left deep fatigue across French society. Jacques Doriot is emerging as a new alternative to break through this national despair. He advocates a ‘politics of unity’ that transcends ideological divisions between left and right, emphasizing pragmatism and order to reunify a fragmented nation. Under his leadership, the Order Party proposes a new vision of national community built upon syndicalism and ethnic solidarity that goes beyond class lines.\n\nRather than relying on mere slogans, he presents a practical roadmap that breaks away from the outdated frameworks of politics. His popular base, formed around veterans and workers, is gradually expanding into a nationwide movement, grounded in the values of order, responsibility, and unity. Doriot’s rise may mark a turning point for France, signaling a transition away from prolonged chaos and toward a new societal system.\n\nFrance is no longer a country swayed by ideological dogmas. It is preparing to be reborn through the will of its people. As Doriot himself said, true unity can only be achieved through order."

 france_wr.10.t:0 "For the Sake of National Stability"
 france_wr.10.d:0 "France now stands at a critical crossroads. Years of social conflict, political paralysis, and repeated clashes between factions have deeply destabilized the lives of our citizens. Above all, the National Assembly has lost sight of its original purpose, drowning in endless debate and partisan interests, becoming an obstacle rather than a pillar of state governance.\n\nThe government can no longer stand idly by in the face of such irresponsible disorder. As the executive power entrusted with safeguarding public safety and national order, we have made the decision to temporarily suspend the functions of the Assembly and concentrate authority within the government. This is an unavoidable measure to protect the nation in times of crisis, and the first step toward unity and stability grounded in the will of the people.\n\nThis decision does not mark the end of democracy. Rather, it is a rite of passage to preserve the true values of democracy amid chaos. In a state of disorder and division, genuine freedom cannot exist. Only ordered liberty and responsible rights can form the foundation of a sustainable state.\n\nThe government will henceforth take the will of the people to heart, and will pursue all reforms and policies solely in the interest of the nation. France will not return to the chaos of the past. We are moving forward—toward a new era and a new order."

 france_wr.11.t:0 "The Popular Movement Ignites"
 france_wr.11.d:0 "Across France, citizens are rising in response to Doriot’s call, launching a grassroots movement to build a new nation with their own hands. This is more than mere propaganda or expressions of support—this is a genuine and voluntary mobilization of the people, acting and organizing for change.\n\nFrom war veterans and the unemployed to the urban poor, citizens of all backgrounds are rallying under the banner of 'Order and Unity'. This movement is growing into a massive wave that transcends the old political order, generating new national energy and laying the groundwork for France's resurgence.\n\nThe government recognizes the potential of this popular movement and is working to systematically organize and institutionalize its momentum. Doriot has declared that this movement represents 'a nation united by the people, for the people'. What began in the streets is now becoming the very axis of national unity."

 france_wr.12.d:0 "To provide the nation's youth with an opportunity to serve the fatherland, the Doriot government has launched a nationwide youth rally. Across public squares and parks, thousands of young people gather, pledging their dedication and sacrifice to the nation and its people.\n\nThis rally is more than a political ceremony—it is a crucible in which a new generation unites and grows under a shared ideal. Many participants are volunteering for military training, community service, and cooperative initiatives, laying the foundation for a loyal and disciplined society.\n\nThe government intends to cultivate this youth movement into a structured force that reinforces national unity and order. The slogan 'A strong France begins with strong youth' is no longer mere rhetoric—it is becoming the guiding principle of our national revival."

 france_wr.13.t:0 "Institutionalizing the Myth of Degeneration"
 france_wr.13.d:0 "The government has officially codified the moral degeneration of the German people as a civilizational truth and incorporated it as a core tenet of state ideology. The Ministry of Education has distributed new textbooks to all schools nationwide, while existing materials related to German literature and philosophy have been completely discarded. Media and publishing institutions have been reorganized under government supervision, and those who disseminate anti-national content are now subject to legal punishment.\n\nGermans are no longer seen merely as foreign adversaries, but as existential threats to the French spirit. In defense of national dignity, all citizens are now required to internalize the proper historical narrative, considered the foundation of patriotism.

 france_wr.16.t:0 "Déat's New Order"
 france_wr.16.d:0 "At the heart of French society, a new ideological current known as the 'New Order' is steadily gaining influence. Marcel Déat, once a theorist discussed only among certain intellectuals and bureaucratic circles, is now drawing attention in the upper ranks of the political establishment, civil service, and even the military.\n\nHis writings and doctrines are quietly circulating and earning respect. His vision of 'Total Socialism,' a technocratic planned state, and the 'depoliticization of governance' resonates deeply with those disillusioned by the current political system. Particularly among those wearied by partisan fragmentation and irresponsible populism, Déat's blueprint for a disciplined and orderly nation has begun to find serious consideration.\n\nThis shift goes beyond ideological sympathy—it is beginning to manifest structurally beneath the surface. Young elite administrators and technically trained experts are increasingly falling under Déat’s intellectual orbit. Reports suggest that in some ministries, informal policy advisory networks are already coalescing around his ideas.\n\nAlthough President Doriot remains formally in power, his foundations are gradually weakening. The press has yet to publicize this undercurrent, but within political circles, it is becoming clear that Déat’s ideology is rising as a new center of authority. This quiet transformation may soon serve as a decisive turning point in the French political landscape."

The bill passed through the proper legislative procedures and was enacted without delay. Upon its promulgation, all political party activities were officially banned. Administrative enforcement has been uniformly carried out across party headquarters and local branches, and legal action against key party figures has been promptly undertaken in accordance with the law. In some regions, there were localized expressions of dissent; however, public security and enforcement units responded on-site and resolved the situation without major conflict. This measure does not target any particular faction but represents a structural decision to reorganize the broader political landscape and ensure greater administrative cohesion and efficiency. The assets of the dissolved parties are now under state supervision and will be managed in accordance with public needs. The entire process is proceeding as planned, and there has been no significant disruption to the daily lives of citizens."

The bill passed through parliamentary review and was enacted without delay, initiating a full-scale implementation of dissolution measures. Major trade union headquarters and branch offices across the country have been closed in accordance with the new legal framework. In some areas, attempts at building occupations and protest gatherings occurred. In response, militia units and law enforcement were deployed to the scenes and peacefully dispersed all such activities. The government emphasizes that this action does not deny the fundamental rights of workers, and a new consultative mechanism is being prepared to support constructive industrial dialogue. Legal procedures involving union leadership are currently underway, and the overall implementation of the policy will proceed without exception.

This statue is not merely a monument; it was conceived as a symbol of the ideals France upholds and the origins from which they sprang.\n\nRobespierre sought to realize the moral legitimacy of the state in the name of popular sovereignty. In his speech, the Mayor of Paris declared, 'We are building today’s nation upon their ideals, and this statue is not just a tribute to the past but a milestone for moving forward.'\n\nNumerous prominent figures from various sectors attended the event. Accompanied by a military band, thousands of citizens gathered in the square, sharing a collective sense of national pride.

France sees us as a strategic balancing force between Eastern and Central Europe and hopes that Italy will join them in shaping a new European order.\n\nThis diplomatic overture has been welcomed by factions aligned with National Syndicalism, but elements within the military and conservative circles have raised concerns about excessive French involvement in our affairs.

In particular, the ideological alignment around national syndicalism represents more than a mere alliance — it is expected to play a pivotal role in reshaping Europe's political landscape.\n\nThis diplomatic breakthrough stands as proof of the consistency and effectiveness of our foreign strategy. Moving forward, we will continue to expand our ideals and influence across Europe through similar strategic partnerships."

 france_wr.22.t:0 "Diplomatic Proposal Rejected"
 france_wr.22.d:0 "Italy has responded to our diplomatic proposal with a cautious yet firm rejection. Our offer to strengthen strategic cooperation was declined on the grounds that it 'does not align with Italy's national interest and sovereignty.' The Italian government emphasized the need to focus on internal affairs and expressed concern that accepting foreign involvement might spark unnecessary tensions.\n\nThis decision is considered a painful diplomatic setback for the French government and may cause some disruption in our broader geopolitical strategy within Europe. We had hoped Italy would serve as a partner to counter the growing influence of Germany and Austria, but this refusal means we must now reevaluate our strategic balance.\n\nDomestically, the rejection has raised criticism over the limits of France's diplomatic influence, and some voices have begun to question Italy's true intentions. Nevertheless, the government has stated it does not see this development as a final failure, but rather as an opportunity to reassess and improve our long-term diplomatic approach.

This decision forms part of a long-term strategy to prepare for an inevitable confrontation with Germany, with the French government pursuing this initiative as a pragmatic move in foreign policy.\n\nThe balance of power in Europe is already shifting dramatically, and France requires a strong strategic partner to counter German expansionism. The Soviet, with its vast human and material resources, can play a critical role in containing German forces on the European front.\n\nThrough this contact, France aims to explore opportunities for intelligence sharing, military strategy coordination, and economic cooperation—each of which would provide significant advantages in any future wartime scenario. In particular, if Germany is forced to fight on two fronts, it would offer France a vital strategic buffer for the defense of the homeland.\n\nFurthermore, economic cooperation with the Soviets would allow France to secure essential military resources and diversify its supply lines.

Specifically, they seek contact for military intelligence sharing, strategic consultations, and economic cooperation.\n\nFrance’s initiative clearly reflects a desire to counter German expansionism. From the Soviet perspective, this is not a proposal to be dismissed lightly. Germany is currently generating tensions on both its eastern and western fronts, and close cooperation with France could significantly increase the strategic burden on the German military.\n\nFurthermore, with the establishment of the National Syndicalist regime in France, an ideological intersection—while far from fully aligned with Leninist principles—has begun to emerge. Within the framework of an anti-German front, there remains ample room for shared strategic interests.\n\nOn the economic front, expanding trade with France could yield considerable benefits for Soviet industry and military production. Securing new supply routes through Western Europe would create a more favorable environment for sustaining the wartime economy.\n\nKremlin advisors have begun reviewing the proposal, and the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs is coordinating an official response. This is not a mere diplomatic gesture. As the geopolitical landscape of Europe is rapidly reshaping, this offer presents us with a new and valuable strategic opportunity."

He emphasized that any restrictions on the presidency under the current system hinder national security and administrative efficiency.\n\nAccordingly, the office of the presidency is now defined in the constitution as ‘the position of a single leader representing the nation, to be maintained unless changed by national consensus.’ The amendment passed with an overwhelming majority from both the Emergency National Council and the National Assembly and was enacted immediately. The government clarified that this measure is not for the sake of dictatorship, but rather a safeguard against political chaos and a guarantee that the people's will is consistently represented.\n\nThis decision has drawn considerable attention from both domestic and international media.

They propose the name 'French People's State', emphasizing that the new state has been founded in the name of the people.\n\nOthers contend that the name 'France,' preserved through centuries of history, should be maintained, with only the political content transformed. They warn that such formal changes could undermine international credibility and sow confusion among the population.\n\nUltimately, the decision lies with the President himself, and all options remain open.

He stated, 'Class must become a language of solidarity, not exclusion. France no longer has any reason to repeat the battles of past revolutions.'\n\nIn line with this vision, the government announced its intention to restrict all political agitation and ideological activities that incite class conflict, and instead promote integrative social policies to encourage communication and understanding among different social strata. The administration also plans to strengthen surveillance of political groups that continue to organize around revolutionary slogans and is preparing legislative reforms to ensure stable governance.\n\nThe declaration has prompted a variety of responses from across French society, with public opinion generally viewing it as a positive step toward easing social tension.

All previous ideologies—including socialism, communism, liberalism, and conservatism—are hereby abolished, and only National Popular Socialism shall hold legitimacy in political and social activities.\n\nNational Popular Socialism is defined as an ideology that combines worker-centered social justice, national unity, and corporatist economic management. All educational, media, and administrative institutions will be reorganized around this ideological foundation. The government explained that this measure is necessary to achieve ‘ideological coherence among the people, uniformity in education, and clarity of political purpose,’ and to overcome internal division caused by pluralism.\n\nConsequently, activities that promote ideological confusion or support alternative belief systems are prohibited. Public and educational institutions will be restructured based on the principles of Popular Socialism. The state’s philosophy will no longer be a matter of debate, but a guiding standard for action."

This system is based on the cooperation of three entities—workers, entrepreneurs, and the state—in jointly shaping policy. Disputes will be mediated through sectoral councils, while a central coordinating body will make final decisions.\n\nThe government declared that this structure aims to ‘mediate class conflict and achieve both productivity and social unity.’ Mandatory syndicates will be established across all sectors of the economy. The existing market-based autonomous structure will be gradually dismantled, paving the way for a state-coordinated economic framework.\n\nThis reform is justified on the grounds of protecting small businesses, stabilizing wages, and increasing industrial efficiency. All enterprises will be required to register with their respective industrial syndicates. The government defines the reform as ‘neither laissez-faire nor totalitarian, but a pragmatic, people-centered middle path,’ and encourages public participation in this new economic order."

Public education, media, and the arts will accordingly enhance mandatory instruction and promotion of France’s national identity.\n\nFurthermore, the legal status of national symbols—such as the flag, anthem, and language—will be strengthened. The clause also includes provisions for the protection of French citizens living abroad. Conversely, ideologies or actions deemed to undermine the national identity will be subject to legal restrictions, and the nationality law will be reinforced.\n\nPresident Doriot concluded his address by stating, “We are one people, one nation, one France,” calling on all citizens to take pride in being part of this new era."

His speech was met with strong support from the thousands of party members and supporters in attendance and was broadcast live via radio across all major cities in the country.\n\nThis congress marked a public declaration of legitimacy for the authoritarian state system, and the government announced that it would proceed with sweeping legal and institutional reforms to establish the New Socialist Order across politics, the economy, and education."

Several individuals were arrested, and others were immediately removed from public office. Although no official statement was issued, leaked internal documents revealed the full extent of the operation. Déat branded them as 'a destructive force disguised as a popular front' and explained that their removal was necessary to build 'a true workers’ state.'\n\nIn his speech, he declared:\n\n\"France shall no longer suffer in an age of division. Those who rebel within the party can no longer walk with us. We must unite and fulfill the task of rebuilding our nation.\"\n\nThis purge has significantly strengthened Marcel Déat’s grip on power, suppressing dissent within the government.

Inside, the factory operates with clockwork precision, walls adorned with crimson slogans reading 'For France!' and portraits of the nation's leader. Below them, production targets from the previous day are displayed on a board, and any group that failed to meet its quota averts its gaze in silence.\n\nPolitical police officers, marked by red armbands, watch over the workers throughout the shift. Propagandists repeat revolutionary slogans through loudspeakers, and even during short breaks, the workers remain under scrutiny. Mistakes invite suspicion, and suspicion can lead to investigation—or imprisonment. Fear hangs over the factory floor, but production does not halt.\n\nNo one dares to voice dissent. In the face of the greater cause—building the Socialist France—personal discomfort is a luxury no one can afford. Workers move like cogs in a great machine, hands tirelessly pushing through their quotas. Meals are rationed and simple, served on metal trays. Names of exemplary workers are posted on the board of honor, while underperformers quietly vanish or fail to return the next day.\n\nThe entire process is governed with precision. The 'Complete Neo-Socialist Economy' transcends individual will in favor of collective efficiency. At its core are the thousands of workers who have become the very gears of the factory. Their labor transforms into rifles and cannons—the tools that shall one day rebuild France.

Those who have upheld discipline on the frontlines and obeyed orders may now become the pillars that will restore the Republic.\n\nGeneral Charles de Gaulle and Monsieur François de La Rocque have quietly emerged onto the political stage. One is a general who champions honor and the independence of the army, the other a symbol of civic order who has led mass movements and paramilitary formations. Their arrival signifies more than just support—it is a ‘declaration by the military’ to restore the nation, and perhaps even the arrival of a new force to replace the feeble politics of old.\n\nToday, we have entered into an agreement with these two men, placing the military's loyalty upon a political foundation. For the sake of public security, for the restoration of order, and to put an end to the anarchic state that threatens our homeland. In a public statement, they pledged to the nation: 'We shall be the sword and shield of France.'\n\nIn response, discussions have begun regarding the introduction of political officers into military units. The command structure is being revised, and the army has begun operations to stabilize public sentiment. Posters bearing the new slogans are appearing across the streets, and the newspapers feature bold headlines: “Honor of the Military, Safety of the Nation.”\n\nThe military is no longer merely a force of arms—it is becoming a political actor representing the will of the people.

A full-scale purge has been carried out against military officers and civilian advisors aligned with the Order Republican Party. Their posts are now being filled with individuals who fully adhere to the ideological goals of the state. Countless documents have been destroyed, slogans replaced, and military education programs thoroughly restructured.\n\nAt the same time, the introduction of the political commissar system is now fully underway. These officers are not mere observers—they are central figures tasked with maintaining ideological unity and ensuring that every operation aligns with the goals of the nation. Headquarters are no longer politically neutral spaces; every unit is now treated as a political entity.\n\nFollowing the purge, some senior officers have resigned, while others have been quietly arrested and are currently under investigation. The people observe this transformation in silence, and some newspapers have already begun calling it ‘a new direction for the military.’\n\nThe military is no longer simply a force of arms.

 france_wr.71.d:0 "In a nationwide radio broadcast, Marcel Déat officially announced his plan to revise the constitution for the reconstruction of France.\n\nIn his address, he asserted that the crisis facing France is not merely political disorder but a symptom of the structural failure of the system itself. Liberal parliamentarianism, he argued, had failed to ensure the people's stability and survival, while Marxism had brought only endless division and civil war. France, he said, had found salvation in neither path.\n\nTo respond to this impasse, Déat declared that a new political ideology, 'Neo-Socialism', would form the core of the nation. This is not a revolution of violence or fragmented reform, but a 'constructive revolution'—led by a strong state and guided by cooperation between the government and technical experts to drive orderly planning and production. Déat announced plans to revise the constitution to establish a system where the state could coordinate and lead society as a whole.\n\nAt the heart of the reform is a significant expansion of presidential power and the creation of a 'National Council' to replace the existing parliament. This council would include representatives from trade unions, technocrats, and industry, participating directly in national planning and bearing responsibility for livelihoods and production. In addition, all political party activity would be severely restricted, marking the end of the divisive political system of the past.\n\nFinally, Déat emphasized that this was not a simple power grab, but a 'necessary and moral responsibility' to restore order and rebuild France. He concluded that a society where no one goes hungry, where people can work and plan for the future, is the vision of Neo-Socialism and the new path for the French nation."

This marks the central doctrine of Neo-Socialism and the new direction for France.\n\nArticle I of the draft declares France to be a 'planned state founded on labor, technology, and order,' assigning the state responsibility for maintaining harmony across all sectors of the economy and society. Article II establishes the 'National Council' as the supreme authority combining legislative and executive powers, composed of representatives from labor unions, technical organizations, and industrial sectors.\n\nPolitical parties are strictly limited. Article III stipulates that party registration and activities will be tightly regulated by the state, described as a measure to protect the people from political fragmentation. All citizens, regardless of class or origin, are to be granted equal rights and social duties, and labor is defined as the highest form of devotion to the nation.\n\nThis constitution is not merely an institutional reform—it functions as a manifesto to reconstruct the shattered state and endow it with a new sense of national unity.

This addition emphasizes that the new political system is not a break from, but a continuation of, France's long tradition of popular struggle.\n\nIt further reaffirms that 'all power emanates from the people,' and proclaims an end to the divisions of the old regime in favor of a new era of unity. Marcel Déat hailed this clause as the spiritual pillar of the new France, stating that the constitution itself will serve as a declaration of the people’s historical victory.\n\nThe inclusion of this revolutionary legacy bestows both legitimacy and moral clarity upon the neo-socialist regime, tying the present directly to the struggles of the past."

These contributions may take the form of military service, social welfare work, or technical and industrial service. This formalizes the core neo-socialist principle that 'labor is the highest form of civic service.'\n\nThis clause is not simply a mandate for service but a declaration of a renewed social contract between the individual and the state. Marcel Déat emphasized that 'every citizen is both sovereign and servant of the nation, and true community arises from unified commitment.'

At the center of the controversy lie the so-called 'Six Core Bills,' which contain major reforms that would restructure key areas such as the distribution of power, industrial control, military organization, educational reform, religious regulation, and media oversight.\n\nMarcel Déat adheres to a direction that strengthens state-led planned economy and technocratic governance, focusing each bill on codifying and institutionalizing a neo-socialist order. In contrast, Doriot favors a more popular and action-oriented form of control, opposes the unification of state apparatuses, and insists on preserving the autonomy of military and labor organizations.\n\nThe problem is that both sides have secured strong support within the Assembly. Every vote ends in a tie, and each delegation in the National Council remains split, preventing the passage of even a single bill. As national governance grinds to a halt, discontent is growing in both industry and the military. The press has labeled this situation 'the first political impasse created by the People's Union.'\n\nSome voices are calling for mediated compromises through negotiation, but both sides maintain that ideological concessions are unacceptable. As such, a short-term compromise appears unlikely.

Déat advocates for a technocratic planned economy and strong centralized control, declaring that 'freedom without order is the enemy of the people.' Doriot counters with a populist emphasis on autonomy and action-based politics, arguing that 'the people cannot be imprisoned in the bureaucratic cage.'\n\nTheir conflict has transcended mere policy disagreements and evolved into an ideological struggle over the direction of the regime and the legitimacy of power. Their respective supporters are already clashing in ministries, the military, trade unions, and local administrations. In some areas, public services have come to a halt, and chains of command are becoming duplicated.\n\nThis political deadlock has now escalated into a full-blown systemic crisis.

But there are those who seek to tear it down, relying solely on emotions and slogans to solve complex problems.'\n\nDéat specifically condemned Doriot's recent initiatives, such as expanding autonomous organizations and mobilizing military and labor unions, labeling them as 'chaotic excesses' that only lead to a new form of concentrated power under the guise of freedom.\n\nHe argued, 'Bureaucracy may have its flaws, but freedom without structure leads to destruction.' Emphasizing that the state must be governed by reason rather than sentiment, Déat’s speech was met with applause from technocrats and state planning advocates, but sparked backlash from grassroots activists.\n\nAs the political deadlock drags on, the rhetoric on both sides has grown increasingly hostile.

Control and design untouched by the people's breath are no different from dictatorship.'\n\nDoriot sharply criticized Déat’s proposed education reforms and media oversight systems, calling them 'textbooks of ideological imposition and enforced silence'—a betrayal of the revolutionary ideals they once shared.\n\n'We did not fight to raise a new tyrant. No justification can be used to suppress the autonomy and actions of the people,' he proclaimed, warning that Déat’s so-called 'Neo-Socialist state model' could usher in a second age of despotism.\n\nHis speech was met with roaring applause from the young activists and union leaders in attendance, and reports indicate Doriot is preparing for a nationwide speaking tour to build on this momentum.

To revive a homeland that has long suffered in division and chaos, France must reclaim its true identity and its rightful strength. Monsieur Bucard solemnly vowed—both to himself and before history—that he shall rebuild a France for the French.\n\nIn his view, the era of corrupt parliamentarianism, foreign interference, and impotent party politics must now come to an end. What the nation requires is not compromise, but true governance—leadership grounded in the unity of people, state, and homeland. Of course, the road ahead shall not be easy. There will be no shortage of condemnation from abroad and resistance within, and countless obstacles are sure to await.\n\nBut he understands this well: it takes the unwavering resolve of a single determined leader to guide millions, and even the harshest path can lead to the restoration of national dignity.

He demanded both loyalty to the state and the assumption of greater social responsibility from the industrial elite. Many corporate representatives expressed general agreement and pledged to follow the government's direction.\n\nExecutives from major corporations in the steel, mechanical, and infrastructure sectors promised to participate in forthcoming state-directed projects. In exchange, the government is expected to provide targeted tax incentives and administrative support. With the interests of state and capital increasingly aligned, observers expect a new framework of cooperation to solidify rapidly.\n\nWhile some commentators have raised concerns over the potential loss of independence for the private sector, the regime insists this meeting was strictly about securing national stability through mutual effort.

 france_wr.90.d:0 "In an effort to resolve widespread instability across the industrial sector and reestablish order in the labor market, the government has entered into direct negotiations with representatives of major corporations. These talks have deliberately excluded existing labor unions, based on the government's assessment that union activity has become excessively ideological and politicized, to the detriment of the national economy.\n\nOfficials have indicated that this measure is not temporary. Rather, it marks the beginning of a structural shift toward a state-directed framework for labor dialogue. The role of independent unions will be gradually diminished, to be replaced by 'cooperative organizations' operating under official supervision and sanction.\n\nThis change represents more than a mere administrative adjustment. It aims to simultaneously achieve higher productivity, greater national cohesion, and the containment of communist agitation. Naturally, segments of the labor movement have decried the decision as an infringement on freedom of association, and some intellectuals have warned of a creeping silencing of the working class.\n\nNonetheless, the government has reaffirmed its position in a quiet but resolute tone: what the nation requires at this moment is not idealism, but order.

 france_wr.91.d:0 "The French government has recently adopted a 'nationalist view of history' as an official state ideology, aiming to reaffirm national identity and pursue a campaign of moral rearmament. This new historical narrative reinterprets France's past wars not as mere political clashes or pragmatic decisions, but as noble sacrifices made for the survival and glory of the nation. Through this, the government seeks to reshape the national consciousness of its people.\n\nA complete overhaul of school textbooks is underway to ensure that the younger generation repeatedly learns of the nation's past glories and trials. Simultaneously, a comprehensive propaganda effort is being conducted via radio broadcasts, newspapers, cinemas, and public posters, encouraging all French citizens to take pride in the hardships their country has endured. Key figures and events are being deliberately emphasized or glorified, fostering a sense that the struggle for the nation is not a personal burden, but a sacred and honorable duty.\n\nThis new historiographical framework is expected to serve as a powerful force for unity and resistance, especially in times of foreign invasion or existential threat to the Republic. Citizens will be encouraged to view the cost in human lives not as a tragedy, but as a solemn act of devotion to the nation. In cases where vital territory is lost, such losses will be met with renewed patriotic fervor and righteous indignation. The government believes that this nationalist spiritual mobilization will serve as a crucial psychological and political foundation for France's diplomatic and military efforts in the years to come."

The state declares a doctrine of 'national salvation through labor,' and workplaces that fail to meet production targets face warnings and constant supervision.\n\nThe Marcel Bucard government brands this policy as 'devotion to the nation,' coordinating work intensity through satellite unions in each workplace. But the reality on the ground is far from ideal. Break times have been shortened, safety standards are largely symbolic, and it is the workers—not the machines—that break down first.\n\nPublic radio boasts of France’s industrial revival and restored global competitiveness, but on the shop floor, workers labor in silence, indistinguishable from the very machines they serve. Among them, a bitter joke circulates: "We don’t wear blue shirts—we wear blackened blood."\n\nThe regime continues to emphasize stability and productivity, and is reportedly tightening surveillance on union figures who display signs of dissent.

This initiative, in addition to conventional military training, aims to instill a repeated and unwavering belief in France’s glorious history and the sacred duty of the nation.\n\nSoldiers now participate in nationalist lectures and oath recitals every morning before drill and again after evening roll call. In some units, these ideological sessions have even taken precedence over firearms instruction. Political officers assigned to each regiment stress that 'the French soldier is not merely a fighter, but a warrior of the nation's soul,' calling for a fundamental transformation in the identity of the military man.\n\nObservers note that this development marks more than a shift in training methods — it is shaping a new spiritual order within the military itself. Slogans such as 'it is not training or arms, but our national mission that dispels fear in battle' are spreading naturally among the troops. Reports from recent field exercises indicate a noticeable rise in morale and resolve.\n\nThe General Staff has welcomed these changes, declaring that 'to overcome the decadence of liberal nihilism and forge a new France unified in will, the military must become the spiritual backbone of the nation.'

The ideological foundations of governance are steadily giving way to a doctrine of precision and pragmatism, encapsulated by a new national slogan: 'Efficiency is the highest form of patriotism.'\n\nThe public response has been quiet but broadly positive. While dissent exists among ideological purists, many now assert that 'a leader should rise from the drafting board, not from the podium.'

In major cities such as Paris, Lyon, and Marseille, spontaneous public gatherings are being held daily. Youth organizations, workers’ councils, and farmers’ unions are all uniting to publicly declare their support for President François de La Rocque’s citizen-centered political order.\n\nThese groups are not merely chanting political slogans, but are taking real action through community service, public order initiatives, and educational seminars, fulfilling their responsibilities as members of society. Newspapers have described this phenomenon as 'the first true national unity since the Third Republic,' and sociologists are noting the emergence of a new political culture that transcends the limitations of past party politics.\n\nThe government views this development as a historic turning point that will strengthen the foundation of the national community. Ministries have already begun work on establishing dedicated agencies to support the organization and expansion of these popular movements. The people of France are no longer just subjects of governance—they are reclaiming their role as the true drivers of the nation’s future."

 france_wr.108.d:0 "Today, President François de La Rocque delivered a historic speech before thousands gathered in the heart of Paris. The core of his address was captured in a single, powerful declaration: “A Frenchman is not a race. A Frenchman is one who shares in the culture, history, and ideals of France.” He emphasized that French citizenship should not be defined by blood or ancestry, but by loyalty to the nation, commitment to the common good, and the defense of universal values. This statement was not mere political rhetoric—it was a deliberate effort to transcend the exclusion, class divisions, and even racist prejudices that had permeated French society.\n\nThe speech was broadcast live across the nation, immediately sparking widespread support from all sectors of society. Among workers, citizens of immigrant descent, and families of colonial veterans, the declaration was received as a message of hope—one that acknowledged their contributions and offered a path to true belonging. The press hailed the moment as 'the return of the French spirit' and 'a redefinition of republican values,' while religious and academic leaders expressed their alignment with the president’s ideological leadership.\n\nFrançois de La Rocque now envisions France not as a mere historical construct, but as a community of citizens united by liberty, duty, and coexistence. This proclamation redefines what it means to be French, affirming that anyone who serves the nation and contributes to the common good can rightfully call themselves a Frenchman."

 france_wr.109.d:0 "A diplomatic communiqué has arrived from Paris. President François de La Rocque has proposed that our government join a 'Scientific and Technological Pact of Latin Civilization,' urging France, Italy, and Spain to strengthen trilateral cooperation in scientific and technological advancement.\n\nThe proposed agreement includes academic exchange between research institutes, joint research in aviation, communications, and logistics, and the rotation of scholars between top universities. It is ideologically grounded in the spiritual unity of Latin Catholic civilization, including the Vatican, as a foundation for scientific progress.\n\nWithin the cabinet, sentiment is generally favorable. Cooperation with France is seen as a chance to challenge the technological dominance of Germany and Britain while providing real benefits to our industrial sector. However, some Foreign Ministry officials caution against drifting into France’s political orbit, and pragmatic voices warn of diplomatic backlash from Berlin.\n\nAccepting this accord would go beyond scientific collaboration—it would signal our civilizational alignment to the world."

This agreement calls for France, Spain, and Italy to coordinate military doctrine and defense strategies in response to the emerging German-centered military order.\n\nThe draft outlines shared border defense planning, limited weapons technology cooperation, and regular joint military exercises in the Mediterranean. President François de La Rocque described the pact as 'the rightful self-defense of Latin civilization against Germanic expansion,' portraying it as a natural alliance between nations united by faith and tradition.\n\nOpinions within our government are divided. The Ministry of Defense and several diplomats see the agreement as a way to elevate our international stature and prepare for potential future conflict. On the other hand, conservatives and members of the foreign policy establishment warn that binding ourselves to a French-led alliance could compromise our diplomatic independence.\n\nShould we accept this offer, we will no longer remain neutral—our position in Europe will be declared unequivocally."

Technical negotiations regarding the establishment of joint research institutes and scientific exchange programs are expected to begin shortly, marking the first step toward intellectual integration among Latin nations.\n\nPresident François de La Rocque issued a public statement immediately, declaring, “This is a union of civilizations—an event in which spiritual brotherhood is realized through the language of science.” Major institutions such as the Paris Academy, the Military Technology Council, and the National Bureau for Industrial Advancement have likewise praised the accord, seeing in it the promise of major advances in aviation, logistics, and communications.\n\nThe press has covered the development with headlines such as “France Emerges as Europe's Academic Capital” and “The Beginning of a Latin Scientific Alliance,” while Catholic media, citing unofficial support from the Vatican, have described the agreement as a symbol of civilizational reunification. This is more than just a scientific collaboration; it is regarded as a strategic turning point that will expand the autonomy and influence of Latin countries within the European order.\n\nUnder the banner of science, France now joins its brother nations to shape the future together."

Their diplomatic note stated that 'the development of national science must remain independent, and cooperation that implies subordination to an external political bloc must be approached with caution.'\n\nPresident François de La Rocque expressed regret but remarked, “The realization of our civilizational mission cannot be achieved in a single day. We believe the Latin world will awaken in due time.” Disappointment is evident within the government, and some advisors believe that economic ties with Germany or a commitment to neutral diplomacy may have influenced the decision.\n\nThe media are reporting the rejection under headlines such as “A Fracture in Latin Unity” and “Between Civilizational Ideals and Political Reality.” Meanwhile, voices within the political establishment are calling for a recalibration of France’s foreign policy strategy. The proposed budget and staffing for the joint research institutes are now under full review.\n\nThough this particular collaboration has failed, the resonance of our offer will endure.

Citing the importance of national military autonomy and diplomatic independence, [FROM.GetName] has opted to postpone any formal alliance—though it has left the door open for possible future cooperation.\n\nGiven that the pact was expected to serve as a cornerstone of France's military strategy, the rejection has dealt a considerable blow to both our diplomatic and defense circles. Within the government, perspectives vary—some interpret this as a sign of fragmentation within the Latin world, while others focus on the diplomatic nuance that suggests room for future dialogue.\n\nOne thing remains clear: France will not waver. Even if others let go of our outstretched hand, we will not abandon our mission to safeguard and lead this civilization."

Latin does not forgive,' revanchist sentiment has begun to spread like wildfire across the nation. Slogans such as 'Never forget 1871. Never forget 1918.' are reappearing on banners in the streets, while numerous civic groups are organizing spontaneous rallies calling for vengeance.\n\nIn the education sector, a new 'Anti-German National Instruction' curriculum is being introduced, and military academies are adopting tactical doctrines based on hypothetical campaigns against German fronts. The press, too, has amplified its rhetoric, denouncing both the crimes of the German past and the ambitions of its present expansionism.\n\nThis movement has grown beyond simple anti-German feeling. It is now uniting French society under a common, powerful sense of collective purpose. While some claim it is extreme, more and more citizens see it as long-overdue justice. France is no longer content with restraint—it is arming itself with the will to never forgive the Germanic enemy again."

The law grants the state the authority to suppress political activities and propaganda that threaten public peace, particularly those involving violence or ideologies deemed dangerous to national unity.\n\nPresident François de La Rocque described the legislation as 'the Republic’s right of self-defense against those who seek to destroy democracy.' Law enforcement agencies across the country were immediately granted expanded powers, and dissolution orders were issued against far-left radical groups and far-right militias in cities such as Paris and Marseille. Numerous subversive political publications were also seized.\n\nThe media response has been mixed. Some outlets hail it as 'a turning point for the restoration of order,' while others warn of the encroachment on freedom of expression. Nevertheless, recent polls show that the majority of citizens support the measure, reflecting a deep public desire for stability and national security."

'A republic cannot be sustained by laws and institutions alone,' he proclaimed. 'It must be built upon morality, faith, and the solidarity of the community.' He promised to unify the nation’s guiding principles, which had long remained divided.\n\nThis address marks not merely a rhetorical shift, but a structural redefinition of the republic rooted in ethical governance, Christian values, and active patriotism. The Ministry of Education has already begun distributing a new national ethics curriculum to schools across the country, while media outlets and local governments have launched a nationwide 'Spirit of the Republic' campaign. In public squares, banners reading 'We are One Republic' wave above spontaneous public readings of the president’s words.\n\nPublic reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. After years of disunity and confusion, citizens feel their country is reclaiming a sense of shared moral direction. Politicians across the spectrum, both left and right, have expressed agreement that the speech marks a redefinition of republican ideals.

 france_wr.118.d:0 "Today, President François de La Rocque publicly released a draft proposal for constitutional reform under the name of the presidency. This is the first time the future direction of the new Republic has been formally presented to the public. At the core of the proposal is the idea that France's state authority must be unified under the leadership of the President.\n\nAccording to the draft, the President would not merely serve as a head of state but act as a leader who directly represents the people and assumes moral responsibility for the nation. While the legislature would continue to exist, decisive administrative authority would be concentrated in the presidency—reflecting the vision of a 'responsible authority' ensuring the stability of the Republic.\n\nThis structure is seen as a departure from the fragmented party politics that previously led to stagnation, aiming instead to build a strong and coherent Republic. Yet, ironically, due to the overly dominant presidency during the Pétain regime, the new constitution ultimately extends parliamentary power and slightly curtails the President's authority in comparison to the past."

Political parties shall serve as channels for public voice, not instruments of power.'\n\nThis represents a complete break from the class-conflict-driven party politics of the past, establishing a new political ideology centered on the common good. The government now defines this as the core tenet of a 'Republic for the People.' The term 'Social Republic' is no longer a formal label—it reflects the moral responsibilities of the entire community."

The President directly represents the people, while the legislature functions as a consultative body. All political parties are redefined as instruments serving the common good, and state power is structured around the ideals of moral responsibility and social order.\n\nAcross the country, spontaneous citizen assemblies are forming, and the full text of the National Ethical Charter is being read on national radio.

Excessive concentration of power in the central government, he claimed, has weakened regional autonomy and traditions, while stifling the creativity of the people.\n\nFrom now on, each region will be granted greater authority and autonomy to develop its economy and society based on its unique culture, history, and resources. The central government will reduce detailed interference and instead focus on its role as a coordinator and supporter. This change will give the regions the opportunity to expand their industries and build more factories, promoting balanced development throughout the nation.\n\nThe press has described this as 'a major transformation in France’s political structure,' while many regional leaders have expressed hope that the reform will usher in a golden age of local development."

 france_wr.138.d:0 "Today, the government of Charles Maurras issued an order to expel from the nation’s borders those individuals and factions within the Jewish community who are hostile to France. However, Jewish citizens who pledge their loyalty to France are not subject to this measure and will instead be welcomed as partners in the nation’s reconstruction. The government announced plans to invest their capital and skills into economic development, restructuring the industrial base of provincial cities, and expanding civilian production capacity. The press has described this as a ‘standard of loyalty and unity,’ reporting that it marks a path for France to stand as one."

 france_wr.139.d:0 "From the streets of Paris to the academies, museums, and even the blueprints of factories, the spirit of Latin classicism is once again taking root. Under the active support of the government, classical architecture and the study of Latin are flourishing, while the principles of ancient philosophy and science are being incorporated into modern industrial design. This is more than a passing cultural trend—it is becoming the driving force behind a transformation of the nation’s research systems and industrial sectors.\n\nIndustrial research institutes are adopting efficient designs inspired by classical aesthetics and structural principles, while universities have made Latin classical studies a mandatory part of their curricula. The press hails this as a ‘French Renaissance,’ predicting that the wisdom of antiquity and the technology of the modern age will together usher in a new era of prosperity. In parks and squares, citizens recite Latin poetry, and artists immerse themselves in creative work inspired by ancient myths and history."

 france_wr.140.d:0 "Today, King Jean III held a grand procession along the boulevard stretching from the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde. The royal procession advanced slowly amid the cheers of the Royal Guard, the honor guard, and countless citizens. From a gilded carriage, the King waved to the people, who responded with cries of ‘Long live the King!’ and ‘For France!’\n\nAt the King’s side was his chief advisor, Charles Maurras, displaying the authority of the monarchy and the unity of the nation. Portraits of the King and the royal coat of arms adorned every building, while the streets were decorated with flower petals and flags. The press described the event as ‘the ultimate symbol of the monarchy’s restoration,’ declaring that the day’s spectacle marked the definitive opening of a new era for France.\n\nThis procession was more than a mere ceremony—it was proof that the authority of the King still lived in the hearts of the people. Many citizens felt that stability, order, and tradition had truly returned."

 france_wr.141.t:0 "Maurras Denounces the German Spirit"
 france_wr.141.d:0 "Today, Charles Maurras delivered a sweeping speech that shook France’s intellectual circles. He argued that what defines Germany is not merely a set of policies but a dangerous doctrine that threatens the very existence of France. At its core, he claimed, German nationalism is racialist—barbaric to human dignity and destructive to social harmony. He condemned the degeneration of German culture, asserting it has abandoned its classical greatness to rely on force and violence, and he attacked the oppressive centralism that tramples liberty and chokes the vitality of the regions.\n\nHis speech did not remain an academic critique. Maurras openly called for retribution, urging the nation to vow never again to bend to Germany. The hall erupted in cheers and tears as the crowd chanted for punishment. Newspapers and radio carried his words across the country, uniting the public in a blaze of anti-German sentiment and pushing any prospect of reconciliation even farther away."

However, if we do not administer these lands properly, continuous uprisings and rebellions are certain to occur. Therefore, we must employ every means at our disposal to integrate these regions fully."
