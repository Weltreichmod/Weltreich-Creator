 france.1.d:0 "Yesterday morning, French troops marched Champagne and other parts of northeastern France, insisting on the destruction of the Frankfurt Treaty.\n\nGermany's Foreign Ministry has formally protested against France, which has brought the world's attention to Europe.  As a result, the Treaty of Frankfurt was completely destroyed due to this French Republic's declaration of rearmament.\n\nWith this, France is completely out of the shadow of World War I and their anti-German moves are likely to become more active, and France is likely to rearm without any restrictions."

 france.4.t:0 "Catalonia Becomes French Territory"
 france.4.d:0 "There was shocking news this morning. The Spanish government agreed to hand over Catalonia to the French government without any conditions. The Spanish government appears to have succumbed to the military pressure of the past military pressure. Catalonia had long been under the influence of Spain and was briefly occupied by France during the Napoleonic Wars. Under the pretext of this, the French government demanded Catalonia, and Spain, which is experiencing great internal chaos, transferred the territory to France without much resistance."
 france.4.a:0 "Well... It may be the beginning of a terrible thing to come."

 france.6.t:0 "Franco-British Alliance"
 france.6.d:0 "A military alliance between France and Britain was established this morning. It seems obvious that the alliance between the two countries will have a lot of influence on the international situation going forward. In particular, the German government seems to regard the alliance as an alliance to fight against Germany. During World War I, the two formed an alliance against Germany, and the re-established alliance is very stimulating for Germany. Many experts also see it as an alliance against Germany, and this massive event may shake things up in Europe."

 france.10.t:0 "Franco-Italian Alliance"
 france.10.d:0 "This morning, the French-Italian alliance was formed. The two countries share the experience of being defeated disastrously by Germany as Entente during the Great War. The fact that these three countries are again allied means only one thing."

 france.15.t:0 "Southern Uprising"
 france.15.d:0 "Georges Valois, whose whereabouts were unknown, rose, criticizing the current regime, mainly in the southern part of the country. They are the only ones claiming to be legitimate government, and the democrats in Paris accuse them of being traitors."

 france.16.t:0 "French Civil War"
 france.16.d:0 "After weeks of tension, France broke out into a civil war divided into north and south. The world is paying attention to who can be the winner of the civil war, between democrats-led Northern France and fascist-led Southern France.

 france.25.t:0 "Italy's alliance with France"
 france.25.d:0 "Yesterday morning, the Italian government declared an alliance with France.

 france.47.t:0 "Defense of France"
 france.47.d:0 "The German occupation of Paris shocked many French people, but the soldiers and people of France were not deterred by it. They all remembered the humiliation of Franco-Prussia, and they remembered the humiliation of the last Great War. They could not be defeated again. No matter how hopeless the situation, France would defeat Germany with indomitable will.\n\nThe French government set up a provisional government in Bordeaux, reminding the people that the fall of Paris would in no way mean the end of France.

A breathtaking silence followed for a moment, and at the end of it [FRA.GetLeader] finally opened her mouth.\n"Ladies, in recent months we have had one serious problem, starting with the Treaty of Frankfurt. Alsace-Loren was a French territory. In addition, Nancy was the rightful territory of our French back in recent decades. All the cultural development in the region was that of the French.\nI will enter this war as a nationalist and a French politician. People, I don't think it's right to give in to an oppressor named Germany. As the most French, it is our destiny to fight against the tyranny of the evil Germanic people.\nThose who wish to reject this national mission will disappear in some way. Remember, for a traitor, death is the only thing.\nThe most noble nation, the French, may you win!\n Vive la!""

 france_wr.1.d:0 "The National Assembly in Paris was unusually silent that day. A crimson light blinked slowly on the radio transmitter atop the desk, and Georges Valois stepped up to the podium. The eyes fixed on him were tangled in expectation and tension; thousands awaited his address.\n\n"We can no longer look away."\n\nHis low voice spread across the microphone.\n\n"Beyond the border, beyond the Rhine, stands a people who once spoke of philosophy, music, and order—but now they are symbols of decadence, arrogance, and greed. Germany has decayed. Justice has vanished from their cities, and truth no longer lives in their words."\n\nHe paused to breathe, his gaze sweeping across the assembly hall.\n\n"But France is different. Our workers sweat without deceit, our farmers pray for the soil of the Republic. We have been broken, but never defiled. We have been poor, but never surrendered."\n\nThe audience gasped in unison. Outside, the crowds listening by radio erupted in cheers.\n\n"In the name of France, we shall eradicate the degenerate culture of Germany and restore proper law and order to all of Europe!""
 france_wr.1.a:0 "Prepare the rifles for them."
 france_wr.2.t:0 "Institutionalizing the Myth of Degeneration"
 france_wr.2.d:0 "The government has officially codified the moral degeneration of the German people as a civilizational truth and incorporated it as a core tenet of state ideology. The Ministry of Education has distributed new textbooks to all schools nationwide, while existing materials related to German literature and philosophy have been completely discarded. Media and publishing institutions have been reorganized under government supervision, and those who disseminate anti-national content are now subject to legal punishment.\n\nGermans are no longer seen merely as foreign adversaries, but as existential threats to the French spirit. In defense of national dignity, all citizens are now required to internalize the proper historical narrative, considered the foundation of patriotism. Valois has made it clear that these measures are a necessary step for the survival of the state, and the people have responded with duty and loyalty."
 france_wr.2.a:0 "It does not matter whether it's true—what matters is that they believe it is."
 france_wr.3.t:0 "The Jewish Question"
 france_wr.3.d:0 "Bucard and his followers are aggressively advocating antisemitism, demanding the social exclusion of the Jewish population. The Legionnaires regard Jews as the root of France’s moral decay and political disorder, calling for their complete removal from public life. They argue that purging Jews from the press, finance, education, and other sectors is the first step toward national renewal.\n\nThe government must now make a decision. We may risk Bucard's backlash and protect the Hebrews, allowing Jewish capital to flow into France on a large scale. Alternatively, we may follow Bucard’s path—expelling the Jews and seizing their assets to provide the foundation for explosive short-term industrial growth."
 france_wr.3.a:0 "Look to the long term. Protect them and maximize the influx of global Jewish capital."
 france_wr.3.b:0 "There is no time for the long term. Seize their assets and accelerate industrial expansion."
 france_wr.4.t:0 "Those Who Left No Names"
 france_wr.4.d:0 "In a quiet corner of Paris, small bookstores have lowered their shutters without a sound. Damp basement shelves filled with Hebrew Bibles and Talmudic commentaries were labeled 'subversive materials' and, days later, loaded onto trucks headed to unknown destinations. A man standing at a bank window on the Champs-Élysées was informed that his account had been frozen. When asked for his surname, he replied—and said nothing else.\n\nThe government officially announced it as 'the removal of external elements threatening national security.' But the people know what that means. Valois said nothing on the matter. Bucard’s followers declared on the streets that 'an era of purification has come.' Even Doriot’s supporters remained silent. Only the Jews packed their belongings.\n\nThe camps outside Lyon are growing crowded. Jewish merchants, journalists, professors, even former officers—none are exempt. Most remain quiet. They do not resist. They simply look at each other in disbelief, with the eyes of those who never imagined they could be cast out so easily.\n\nThe trains are running on schedule. No destinations are posted. The station masters keep their mouths shut. There are no trials, no indictments, no right to appeal. Once the state has turned its eyes away, these people become no one at all."
 france_wr.4.a:0 "And no one dares speak their names."
 france_wr.5.t:0 "Antisemitic Bill Rejected"
 france_wr.5.d:0 "Several days ago, the so-called 'Public Order and National Identity Restoration Act'—an antisemitic bill spearheaded by Bucard’s faction—was brought to the National Assembly for a vote. The bill sought to exclude Jewish citizens from key public sectors such as media, finance, and education, and included provisions to restrict their economic activities. Bucard’s allies argued that this law was essential for the moral reconstruction of France. However, many deputies, even beyond Bucard's faction, either abstained or voted against it, and the bill was ultimately defeated.\n\nSoon after the vote, rumors began to circulate in political circles that the government had held unofficial negotiations with prominent Jewish financiers and community leaders ahead of the vote. Some media outlets have published circumstantial evidence supporting these claims. In particular, a delayed report revealing a 'budgetary adjustment agreement' between the National Industrial Bank and a major Jewish foundation has intensified the controversy.\n\nBucard’s camp has reacted with fury. They have declared this moment 'the day the government sold out the interests of the nation' and are now demanding the release of names of Jewish officials and lawmakers within the administration. Far-right Legionnaire newspapers have accused Valois of 'serving bank accounts, not the people,' while some regional militia groups have staged armed demonstrations outside government buildings.\n\nThe government has not issued an official statement. Prime Minister Valois remains silent, while emergency closed-door meetings continue. The Doriot faction appears poised to seize this moment to shift the internal balance of power, and even members within the ruling coalition have voiced concern over the growing turmoil surrounding the bill’s handling."

 france_wr.6.t:0 "Concessions to the Bucard Faction"
 france_wr.6.d:0 "In order to quell the large-scale unrest caused by Bucard and his faction following the rejection of the recent anti-Semitic legislation, Valois has decided to appoint a significant number of Bucard's supporters to key government positions. This move appears to be a strategic attempt to prevent further political instability.\n\nGiven the number of appointees relative to Bucard's faction size, and considering their distinctly right-wing orientation, many analysts believe that France is likely to undergo a noticeable shift toward the right in the near future."
 france_wr.6.a:0 "They must be appeased."
 france_wr.7.t:0 "Bucard Joins the Party"
 france_wr.7.d:0 "Marcel Bucard has finally been officially admitted into the French National Syndicalism Party. Until now, he had operated as a collaborator, exerting indirect influence, but with this decision, he is now undeniably part of the system. Valois described this move as 'a step toward national integration,' stating that Bucard's militia and rural organizational base needed to be restructured under formal state control.\n\nSome centrist figures have expressed concern that this decision might dilute the identity of the party. However, Valois insists that integrating Bucard is the most effective way to monitor and manage his influence from within. Bucard is no longer an outsider. He is part of the system, incorporated into the party's framework. His words will be recorded, and his actions will be judged. Now, we can manage him."
 france_wr.7.a:0 "Until he is fully integrated..."
 france_wr.8.t:0 "Integration of Bucard"
 france_wr.8.d:0 "The Valois government has successfully completed the full absorption of the Bucard faction into the system. Once a source of independent agitation, the far-right militias and political organizations that followed Bucard are now clearly part of the national syndicalist order.\n\nBucard's personal influence has already been curtailed, and his closest allies have been dispersed under central supervision. The militias have either been disbanded or restructured under national defense forces, and the remaining elements have been integrated into organizations directly subordinate to Valois.\n\nThe reactionary forces are no longer a threat to the state. They have lost their voice—they are now under our control, and they serve within our order."
 france_wr.8.a:0 "A success."
 france_wr.9.t:0 "Commemorating the Commune"
 france_wr.9.d:0 "A large-scale commemorative event for the Second Paris Commune has been held in Paris with official government authorization for the first time. Thousands of citizens, syndicalist youth groups, and former workers’ militia members attended the event, which included speeches and cultural programs honoring the fallen and revisiting the legacy of the revolution.\n\nThe government praised the event as 'a platform for unity, preserving order through remembrance of past tragedy,' and some state-aligned media outlets have hinted that it may soon be elevated to a recurring national observance. The Ministry of the Interior declared the peaceful outcome as evidence of the administration’s flexibility and responsiveness to public sentiment.\n\nHowever, backlash has been swift. Bucard’s faction and several far-right officials with militia backgrounds have decried the event as 'a formal sanctification of revolutionary romanticism that undermines national legitimacy.' One anonymous Franciste figure sharply criticized the government, claiming it had 'capitulated to the specter of the Red past in exchange for superficial peace.'\n\nPrime Minister Valois responded publicly: 'We do not deny the past. But it is our right to define it within the system we now uphold.' The revolution is over, but its legacy continues to confront today’s power."
 france_wr.9.a:0 "A step toward unity."
 france_wr.10.t:0 "Cabinet Reorganization"
 france_wr.10.d:0 "Key members of the Doriot faction have recently been appointed to senior government posts through a cabinet reshuffle. Valois explained that 'true order begins when labor and the state stand united.'\n\nWith Doriot-aligned figures now occupying positions such as Deputy Minister of the Interior and Vice Chair of the Industrial Policy Committee, the syndicalist left has officially entered the governmental structure. This move is being seen as both a reinforcement of regime diversity and a political mechanism for managing internal tensions.\n\nHowever, backlash from the Bucard faction has been swift. Several advisors with militia backgrounds have denounced the move as 'a red reconciliation of the system,' arguing that the moment Doriot entered the cabinet, the national syndicalist regime lost its ideological clarity. One Franciste official reportedly stormed out of a closed-door meeting, shouting that 'the revolutionaries are now giving the orders.'\n\nValois is said to have remarked privately, 'Loyalty from the right or left is always relative. I accept not ideology, but loyalty I can control.' The uneasy balance holds—for now—but its weight grows heavier by the day."
 france_wr.10.a:0 "The road to unity is a hard one."
 france_wr.11.t:0 "Formation of the Patriotic Internationalist Front"
 france_wr.11.d:0 "Under Valois's coordination, the 'Patriotic Internationalist Front' has been officially established. This is the result of a power-sharing arrangement between national syndicalism and international socialism, based on mutual oversight and cooperation. With the inclusion of Doriot-aligned members in the cabinet, institutional legitimacy has been extended to their faction.\n\nWhile some critics denounce this as a 'corrupt compromise,' most observers agree that the move has contributed to domestic stability and has successfully absorbed the extremes of political polarization into the structure of the regime.\n\nThe Italian government has also praised the development, describing it as the kind of action a responsible administration should take. Even within an unstable balance, a new front has been formed. This front is not simply a pact of cooperation, but a space for control and institutionalized rivalry. Valois has so far managed to maintain the balance—but how long it will last remains uncertain."
 france_wr.11.a:0 "A success."
 france_wr.12.t:0 "Integration of Doriot"
 france_wr.12.d:0 "After a long period of conflict, the Valois regime has finally succeeded in fully absorbing the Doriot faction into the state apparatus. Once born from street slogans and workers' militias, their movement has now been incorporated into the legitimate political framework, functioning as a part of National Syndicalism.\n\nDoriot himself remains a symbolic figure, but his actual influence has been substantially curtailed. His key allies have been dispersed across government ministries and are now subject to regular party oversight. Formerly impassioned grassroots organizations have been dissolved or restructured into educational and cultural institutions, with their rhetoric now absorbed into the official language of the Valois system.\n\nThe Doriotists are no longer an independent threat. They are honored as a memory of revolution, yet governed as a managed element within the Valois order. They no longer raise their voices—they now act in service of order."
 france_wr.12.a:0 "A success."
 france_wr.13.t:0 "Cooperation with Doriot-Aligned Unions"
 france_wr.13.d:0 "The government has recently approved a limited cooperation plan with the leadership of the Doriot-aligned unions. Promoted under the banner of 'a cornerstone for social integration,' the initiative includes the formal invitation of key union representatives to participate in the Labor Policy Council.\n\nValois described the move as 'a pragmatic adjustment for the realization of National Syndicalism,' while the union leaders responded by calling it 'the beginning of patriotic service beyond ideology.' However, the Ministry of the Interior and some bureaucratic factions have warned that this decision may be seen as legitimizing the Doriot faction’s growing influence.\n\nDoriot’s side is demanding stronger protections and broader participation rights for frontline workers, which could inflame tensions with other factions within the regime. The Valois government has repeatedly stressed that cooperation is not concession, and that it will only continue within a strictly controlled framework. Once again, the regime finds itself precariously balanced."
 france_wr.13.a:0 "The cornerstone of France's salvation."
 france_wr.14.t:0 "Backlash Against the New Labor Policy"
 france_wr.14.d:0 "The Valois regime’s 'Labor for the State' policy centers on a structural reorganization of industrial production and a state-directed economic model. It is widely interpreted as a move to solidify the urban working class base while tightening the regime’s grip on the economy.\n\nHowever, this initiative has sparked ideological tensions among key figures within the government. Most notably, Marcel Bucard—a prominent figure from the Catholic corporatist faction—has harshly criticized the policy as a threat to France’s stable economic system.\n\nBucard warns that the state is leaning too heavily toward the working class and risks degenerating into a leftist compromise. He argues that 'Labor for the State' is trapped in a mechanistic obsession with productivity, ignoring the broader order of the nation. He has even publicly demanded the withdrawal of the policy during cabinet meetings.\n\nHis remarks have resonated with several National Syndicalist-leaning officers and moderate right-wing party members, bringing underlying ideological divisions within the regime to the surface. Though the Valois government has yet to take formal action against Bucard, continued expressions of dissent could escalate into a deeper fracture within the administration."

 france_wr.15.d:0 "The Valois regime’s decision to abolish child labor has caused significant ripples across French industry. Though publicly framed as an expansion of educational rights and a humanitarian reform, the policy has drawn concern from several voices within the regime.\n\nMost notably, Marcel Bucard has warned that the measure could severely disrupt wartime industrial mobilization. He condemned what he described as the 'moral idealism of the socialists,' claiming that the policy ignores practical realities. In certain labor-intensive regions, he argued, a manpower shortage has already begun to emerge.\n\nDuring a cabinet meeting, Bucard declared, 'Policies crafted without those who understand the factory floor are not made for the people — they are made for ideology.' His criticism has rekindled existing tensions within the government, and it is becoming increasingly likely that dissatisfaction among the Bucard faction may evolve into organized resistance."

 france_wr.16.t:0 "Controversy Over the Use of Doriot's Propaganda"
 france_wr.16.d:0 "The Valois regime has recently decided to disseminate propaganda and slogans originating from Jacques Doriot’s faction across the country. Their messaging, which appeals directly to the sentiments of the working class, has proven to be an effective tool. The regime views this as a pragmatic measure to bolster its legitimacy within a tightly controlled framework.\n\nHowever, this decision has sparked fierce debate within the government. Marcel Bucard harshly criticized the move, describing the propaganda as 'overtly Leninist' and warning that it could lead the nation toward revolutionary upheaval. He further argued that the emotional and unstructured nature of Doriot’s rhetoric mobilizes anger without political direction, thereby undermining trust in the state.\n\nSeveral moderates have echoed these concerns, cautioning that such tactics may offer short-term gains at the expense of long-term stability. While the Valois regime maintains that the use of this messaging remains strictly limited, there is growing unease that public sentiment could spiral out of control, deepening internal divisions within the government."
 france_wr.16.a:0 "Agitation is a double-edged sword."
 france_wr.17.t:0 "Doriotist Opposition"
 france_wr.17.d:0 "The Valois regime's recently announced policy of 'Expanding Private Property for Farmers' is part of a broader plan to strengthen France's traditional agricultural base and promote a self-reliant rural economy centered around small landowners. Officially, it is framed as a pragmatic effort to increase the independence of the farming class and ensure long-term social stability.\n\nHowever, this policy has drawn fierce opposition from the Doriotist faction, which claims to represent the interests of the urban working class. Jacques Doriot condemned the move as a 'reactionary act that revives the bourgeois illusion of land ownership,' accusing the regime of attempting to return the fruits of collective labor to private hands.\n\nHe declared that 'the regime is using the land question to divide the people,' and argued that the policy is a deliberate attempt to dismantle class solidarity between urban and rural laborers. The Doriotists now view this measure as a dangerous shift in the regime’s direction and have begun preparing for more direct political intervention."

 france_wr.18.d1:0 "Shortly after the declaration of war against Germany, this morning, the long-feuding factions of Doriot and Bucard, previously under the tenuous control of Georges Valois, have agreed to form a complete alliance in the face of the enormous threat posed by Germany.\n\nAlthough the two factions had long clashed politically—particularly over economic matters—the looming war has compelled them to set aside their disputes and fully integrate in a united effort against Germany. Valois hailed this as the greatest unification in French history, and it appears that France will now enter the war against Germany in a more unified and resolute state."
 france_wr.18.d2:0 "Shortly after the declaration of war against Germany, this morning, the long-feuding factions of Doriot and Bucard—previously under the control of Georges Valois—have decided to form a complete alliance in the face of the immense threat posed by Germany.\n\nThe two factions, often at odds especially over political and economic issues, have chosen to set aside their differences and unite fully in order to confront the German menace. Valois described this as the greatest unification in French history. However, due to the deep-rooted tensions that shaped this alliance, sharp disagreements persist on several key issues. These internal frictions continue to affect France’s stability even in this time of crisis."

 france_wr.19.d:0 "This morning, a historic ceremony took place in the central square of Paris. Statues commemorating Georges Sorel, the spiritual mentor of the French socialist movement, and Maximilien Robespierre, the symbol of revolution and embodiment of national will, were officially unveiled. These statues are not mere sculptures—they are monuments that represent the ideals France aspires to and the origins from which they stem.\n\nSorel emphasized action-oriented socialist ethics, focusing on practice over abstract idealism. Robespierre sought to realize the moral legitimacy of the state in the name of popular sovereignty. Though from different eras, both profoundly shaped the spirit of the French people. In his speech, Georges Valois stated, 'We are building today’s nation upon their ideals, and these statues are not only to honor the past but also to guide us toward the future.'\n\nThe ceremony was attended by numerous prominent figures from all walks of life. With the military band’s performance and thousands of citizens gathered in the square, the event was a moment of shared national pride. Their statues now stand on France’s path—not just forms of stone and iron, but beacons of spirit reminding us of where we came from and where we must go."

 france_wr.22.d:0 "For reasons unclear, the Italian government has rejected our offer of support.

 france_wr.23.t:0 "France's Official Support for the Italian Nationalists"
 france_wr.23.d:0 "Today, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a bold diplomatic announcement, formally and fully declaring support for the nationalist factions within Italy. This move, made under the directive of the Valois government, is widely interpreted as a signal of France's active engagement in the reorganization of the European order.\n\nIn his speech, Valois proclaimed, 'If the brothers of National Syndicalism are threatened by the lawless ideology of communism, France will not remain silent,' delivering a strong message to the international community. Consequently, a large aid package consisting of military supplies, medical goods, and financial resources has begun its transfer to the nationalist camp in northern Italy.\n\nDomestically, public opinion is divided, but the military and the Ministry of the Interior maintain that 'this is an inevitable step for geopolitical advantage and alliance expansion.' Through this initiative, France appears to be simultaneously preparing for potential conflict with Germany and promoting the expansion of its ideology across Europe.\n\nAs the red shadow looms across the borders, France seeks to project its influence beyond them."

Unity across nation, class, and region is no longer just a promise of ideology—it is now a living reality.\n\nA grand military parade was held in the capital, Paris, and delegates from across the country gathered to adopt a new charter. We have not merely overthrown the old regime; we have laid the foundation for a new world.

 france_wr.26.t:0 "Preparing to Contact the Soviets"
 france_wr.26.d:0 "This morning, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally initiated procedures to establish diplomatic contact with Soviet Russia. This decision forms part of a long-term strategy to prepare for an inevitable confrontation with Germany, with the French government pursuing this initiative as a pragmatic move in foreign policy.\n\nThe balance of power in Europe is already shifting dramatically, and France requires a strong strategic partner to counter German expansionism. The Soviet, with its vast human and material resources, can play a critical role in containing German forces on the European front.\n\nThrough this contact, France aims to explore opportunities for intelligence sharing, military strategy coordination, and economic cooperation—each of which would provide significant advantages in any future wartime scenario. In particular, if Germany is forced to fight on two fronts, it would offer France a vital strategic buffer for the defense of the homeland.\n\nFurthermore, economic cooperation with the Soviets would allow France to secure essential military resources and diversify its supply lines. This will serve as a crucial foundation for sustaining the war effort in the long term."
 france_wr.26.a:0 "We can expect promising results."
 france_wr.27.t:0 "France’s Proposal"
 france_wr.27.d:0 "This morning, an official diplomatic letter arrived from the French government. In it, they expressed deep concern about the current state of European affairs and conveyed their intention to pursue diplomatic cooperation with the Soviet government. Specifically, they seek contact for military intelligence sharing, strategic consultations, and economic cooperation.\n\nFrance’s initiative clearly reflects a desire to counter German expansionism. From the Soviet perspective, this is not a proposal to be dismissed lightly. Germany is currently generating tensions on both its eastern and western fronts, and close cooperation with France could significantly increase the strategic burden on the German military.\n\nFurthermore, with the establishment of the National Syndicalist regime in France, an ideological intersection—while far from fully aligned with Leninist principles—has begun to emerge. Within the framework of an anti-German front, there remains ample room for shared strategic interests.\n\nOn the economic front, expanding trade with France could yield considerable benefits for Soviet industry and military production. Securing new supply routes through Western Europe would create a more favorable environment for sustaining the wartime economy.\n\nKremlin advisors have begun reviewing the proposal, and the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs is coordinating an official response. This is not a mere diplomatic gesture. As the geopolitical landscape of Europe is rapidly reshaping, this offer presents us with a new and valuable strategic opportunity."

The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs warmly welcomed our proposal for diplomatic cooperation and expressed readiness to begin detailed talks on military, economic, and intelligence collaboration.\n\nThis news has been received positively within the French government. With tensions against Germany escalating, the prospect of a strong eastern partner will greatly strengthen France’s strategic position. More importantly, this agreement sends a clear signal to the nations of Europe that France is not isolated on the international stage.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is already preparing the first working-level meetings, where the concrete framework for military strategy and intelligence sharing will be discussed. Economic cooperation will also be a key topic, with expectations of tangible gains in securing military resources and diversifying supply lines.\n\n[FRA.GetLeader] stated during a cabinet meeting, “We are building a strong international alliance to counter German expansionism. This agreement marks an important victory for French diplomacy, and we will make the most of this opportunity.”\n\nFrance is now expanding its fronts.

While acknowledging the gravity of the European situation, they have declined our proposal for diplomatic cooperation. Citing their commitment to national security and ideological independence, the Soviets emphasized the need for caution in forming external alliances.\n\nThe rejection has caused both disappointment and concern within the French government. As the threat of conflict with Germany looms, securing a strong eastern partner was a critical strategic goal. This outcome raises worries about potential diplomatic isolation.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement asserting, “We will mobilize all available means to reshape the strategic balance in Europe. One rejection will not alter the course of French diplomacy.” France remains determined to expand its influence on the international stage, and even this setback may serve as a stepping stone toward new opportunities.\n\nWith war against Germany drawing near, France must now walk its path alone."

This accord is intended to help France break out of international isolation and rebalance the European front.\n\nA senior official at the Foreign Ministry stated, 'We must now approach this matter not merely as a question of principle or pragmatism, but as a question of survival.

The Soviet must carefully consider its response in the interest of maintaining balance on the European front. While France’s National Syndicalist system does not entirely align with our ideological stance, there is ample room for shared strategic interests.\n\nThe Kremlin must now decide whether to respond positively to this proposal."

The General Staff and Strategic Planning Bureau have been instructed to explore alternative diplomatic and military strategies.\n\n[FRA.GetLeader] stated during a cabinet meeting, 'This rejection means we must prepare a more autonomous and robust strategy for our fight against Germany.

Citing the current geopolitical situation in Asia and Europe, as well as its own strategic considerations, Japan has decided that it cannot proceed with the agreement at this time.\n\nThe French Foreign Ministry does not view this outcome as a major diplomatic setback for now, but acknowledges that it will likely complicate efforts to improve relations with Japan in the near future.\n\nThis situation once again highlights the complex web of interests on the international diplomatic stage, and France intends to proceed with greater caution as it continues to expand its diplomatic reach."

This delivery includes infantry equipment and artillery, reaffirming France’s commitment to actively supporting the enhancement of our combat capabilities.\n\nAmid rising tensions across Europe, this military aid from France is regarded by the Italian government as a highly timely and valuable contribution. The Ministry of Defense plans to immediately redistribute the equipment to key frontlines and defensive positions, with the goal of significantly strengthening the army’s overall combat readiness.\n\nThe Italian government views this aid as more than a simple material contribution. It symbolizes the deepening military trust and cooperation between France and Italy, and serves as a clear example of the growing strategic ties between the two nations in the eyes of the international community.\n\nThe government expresses its sincere gratitude to the French government and looks forward to continued close military cooperation and strategic collaboration in the future."

 france_wr.55.d:0 "Shocking news has rocked France. Georges Valois, the symbolic leader of the National Syndicalist movement and a central figure in the nation’s reconstruction, has fallen to an assassin’s bullet on the streets of Paris. The attack took place as he was returning home after delivering a speech. The perpetrator remains at large, though the police strongly suspect political motives behind the act.\n\nValois’s sudden death has shattered the fragile political balance that had sustained the Valois regime. The Cabinet and the National Syndicalist Party are in deep shock, while the factions of Bucard and Doriot are already casting veiled accusations at one another. The Bucardists, in particular, are claiming that Doriot’s radical elements may be behind the assassination, an accusation to which the Doriotists are fiercely objecting.\n\nTensions between the two factions are now rising uncontrollably, with signs of imminent clashes already visible throughout Paris. Various groups are moving openly to strengthen their positions, seeking to exploit the political vacuum. The government is considering declaring a emergency martial law to contain the unrest, but whether it can maintain control remains uncertain."

 france_wr.56.d:0 "In the aftermath of Georges Valois's assassination, sporadic clashes have begun to erupt across Paris and major cities, as various factions seek to exploit the political vacuum. In particular, reports from the northern industrial regions indicate violent confrontations between Doriot-aligned trade unionists and Bucardist militia forces.\n\nIn the region of Roubaix, Doriot supporters staged a surprise demonstration, prompting a forceful response from Bucard’s organized Francist militias. The clashes resulted in numerous injuries, and some armories were reportedly looted during the chaos. The government has rushed military and gendarmerie units to the area, but both sides are refusing to withdraw.\n\nThe political leadership remains divided and unable to reach a clear course of action. While some ministers advocate for the immediate declaration of martial law, others fear that such a move would further provoke both factions and escalate the conflict. Meanwhile, a growing sense of anxiety is spreading among the populace, and fears of an impending French civil war are beginning to grip the nation."

 france_wr.57.d:0 "Amidst the growing instability, violent bloodshed has now reached the capital. Radical youth groups aligned with Doriot clashed fiercely with Bucardist militias in Place de la Madeleine. Both sides reportedly deployed automatic weapons and improvised explosives during the confrontation.\n\nThe incident was sparked when Doriot supporters organized a mass demonstration condemning the assassination of Valois. The Bucardist faction denounced the rally as 'revolutionary provocation aimed at disrupting public order' and deployed armed security units in response. What followed was an intense street battle, resulting in dozens of civilian casualties caught in the crossfire.\n\nThe Paris Prefecture has effectively lost control over large parts of the city. Although the Prime Minister has declared a state of emergency across Paris, neither faction has shown any intention of backing down. Both the Doriotists and Bucardists are now rallying their supporters, each claiming to represent the true legitimacy of the national government. Paris is now on the brink of political civil war."

The perpetrator was immediately apprehended at the scene, and early investigations have revealed ties to a far-right youth group affiliated with Bucard. Valois had recently pursued increasingly left-leaning policies, including closer cooperation with Doriot, which had provoked growing unrest among the conservative factions.\n\nThis incident appears to be more than an isolated act of violence — it is a symptom of the deepening divisions within the French state. With the death of its head of government, France enters a new phase of uncertainty, its political foundation shaken and its unity increasingly fragile."

 france_wr.59.d:0 "Following the assassination of Georges Valois and the prolonged political vacuum, armed clashes have finally erupted in Paris, the very heart of French politics. Supporters of Jean-Pierre Bucard and Jacques Doriot, each claiming legitimacy, have taken to the streets, turning the capital into a battlefield overnight.\n\nBucard's faction, calling for the restoration of order and tradition, has begun seizing public institutions with the backing of elements within the army and police. Meanwhile, Doriot's camp, invoking the completion of the revolution, has mobilized workers' organizations and militias to take control of key labor districts.\n\nParis is now torn between two rival claimants, and the cost is being borne by the city's civilians. Government functions have ground to a halt, and essential infrastructure like water and power supply is in disarray. This is no longer a temporary clash—it is clearly the beginning of a prolonged urban war.\n\nFrance now faces yet another civil conflict under the banner of National Syndicalism. But this time, there is no room for foreign mediation or third-party arbitration. This is a war between the French themselves, and Paris stands at its epicenter."

Both sides recognize that this battle is not merely a skirmish, but a decisive moment that will determine the future of France. Since dawn, fierce fighting has raged across the square and surrounding districts as both factions strive to seize control.\n\nBucard’s camp, having secured support from reservists and segments of the police force, has deployed heavily armed units calling for the restoration of order and a strong national rebirth. In contrast, Doriot’s faction defends the City Hall with militias and citizen brigades rooted in labor unions, proclaiming themselves the true heirs of the French Revolution.\n\nNeither side can afford to retreat. To surrender is to witness the collapse of their vision; to win is to claim absolute power. Public institutions have been paralyzed, and the capital’s order has crumbled. Gunfire and explosions echo across the Opéra and Rue de Rivoli as Parisians hold their breath, watching the unfolding battle. Amid the chaos before City Hall, the victor will be..."

Once a bastion of revolution and a symbol of monarchical downfall, the palace now serves as a stronghold for Doriot's faction.\n\nThe clash between the two sides has escalated beyond a mere military engagement into a symbolic struggle of history, ideology, and class.\n\nExplosions and gunfire engulf the area in front of the Louvre, with smoke drifting across the Seine. Meanwhile, remnants of the French military remain paralyzed, unable to decisively support either side. Civilians flee into metro tunnels and church crypts for safety, as the heart of the capital descends into chaos — a second civil war in all but name.\n\nThe fate of the Tuileries Palace is tied to the fate of France itself.

 france_wr.1002.t:0 "Rising Influence of the Doriot Faction"
 france_wr.1002.d1:0 "In recent weeks, the Doriot faction has regained momentum, particularly within northern industrial zones and port unions. Following a live broadcast of Doriot’s impassioned rally calling for a 'Workers’ France,' reports suggest a resurgence of nostalgia for 'true syndicalism' among the populace.\n\nThe central office continues to classify the movement as limited agitation, yet several union leaders have discreetly voiced support for Doriot. Party registration records also indicate a marked increase in new members sympathetic to his line.\n\nCompared to Bucard’s faction, Doriot’s is less extreme but more radical in its syndicalist egalitarianism. His faction demands a reorientation of the system around the working class rather than state authority. Attempts to revive the narrative of the Second Paris Commune have also begun to find traction among left-wing intellectuals.\n\nWhile Valois insists that 'we remember the past but do not return to it,' the factories, streets, and docks speak a different language. Doriot's rhetoric echoes once more—not merely as a memory, but perhaps as the herald of new possibilities."
 france_wr.1002.d2:0 "Reports indicate that the Doriotist faction has begun to reassert its presence within the party. Once sidelined from the official line, they are now engaging in organized political activity centered around labor unions and left-leaning civic groups, aiming to push their interpretation of syndicalism into the party’s mainstream discourse.\n\nRather than resorting to confrontation, they have adopted a strategy of influence—through internal forums, publications, and legislative proposals at the local level. Among younger party members, there are signs of growing interest in the faction’s egalitarian rhetoric, and while the movement has yet to significantly shape national policy, its presence is being felt.\n\nThe Valois government currently regards this trend as a natural expression of ideological diversity within the party. However, several advisors have warned that if left unchecked, the Doriotist revival could erode party cohesion and strain alliances with centrist and conservative elements. Doriot’s words may no longer echo in the streets, but they resonate still in the halls of politics."

 france_wr.1003.t:0 "Rising Influence of the Bucard Faction"
 france_wr.1003.d1:0 "The presence of the Bucard faction within the Valois regime is steadily growing. In recent weeks, reports have surfaced of Bucard-aligned officials exerting unofficial influence over key policy meetings and personnel decisions. In some departments, documents are said to remain unsigned without their tacit approval.\n\nWhile Bucard himself avoids public appearances, his confidants have begun referring to themselves as the 'vanguard of national regeneration' within the party and are actively building a base of support. In ministries where former militia members have been reassigned, reports indicate a growing culture of Francist-style obedience among lower-ranking officials.\n\nThe Ministry of the Interior claims the situation remains a 'manageable divergence,' but in reality, Valois’s control appears increasingly limited in certain sectors, and public sentiment is slowly shifting toward right-wing narratives.\n\nSome party members view this as a strengthening of national syndicalism, while others express concern that the center of power is drifting. A quiet but certain transformation is underway. Bucard’s name may still be whispered, but his influence is already being felt—in meeting halls and on the streets."
 france_wr.1003.d2:0 "Reports have surfaced indicating growing dissatisfaction among members of the Bucardist faction regarding certain recent policy directions. While they continue to maintain a veneer of loyalty, internal meetings have seen repeated concerns raised over what they describe as a weakening of national order and excessive concessions to the working class.\n\nIn particular, Bucardist figures have criticized the Valois regime’s emphasis on welfare expansion and industrial intervention, accusing it of being 'guided by leftist sentimentality.' Some senior officials have gone so far as to describe the current course as 'undisciplined idealism' and have hinted at the need to realign the party’s strategic orientation.\n\nNo formal challenge has yet been issued, but Bucardist influence appears to be growing in document review processes and interdepartmental appointments. Among staffers and bureaucrats, there is increasing talk of a slow but steady shift in the party’s center of gravity. Quiet discontent may soon give way to open pressure."
