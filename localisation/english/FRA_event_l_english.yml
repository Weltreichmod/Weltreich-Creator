 france.1.d:0 "Yesterday morning, French troops marched Champagne and other parts of northeastern France, insisting on the destruction of the Frankfurt Treaty.\n\nGermany's Foreign Ministry has formally protested against France, which has brought the world's attention to Europe.  As a result, the Treaty of Frankfurt was completely destroyed due to this French Republic's declaration of rearmament.\n\nWith this, France is completely out of the shadow of World War I and their anti-German moves are likely to become more active, and France is likely to rearm without any restrictions."

 france.4.t:0 "Catalonia Becomes French Territory"
 france.4.d:0 "There was shocking news this morning. The Spanish government agreed to hand over Catalonia to the French government without any conditions. The Spanish government appears to have succumbed to the military pressure of the past military pressure. Catalonia had long been under the influence of Spain and was briefly occupied by France during the Napoleonic Wars. Under the pretext of this, the French government demanded Catalonia, and Spain, which is experiencing great internal chaos, transferred the territory to France without much resistance."
 france.4.a:0 "Well... It may be the beginning of a terrible thing to come."
 france.5.t:0 "They choose war."
 france.5.d:0 "Eventually, the Spanish government refused to give us Catalonia and chose war. Well, Let's step on it very thoroughly."

 france.6.t:0 "Franco-British Alliance"
 france.6.d:0 "A military alliance between France and Britain was established this morning. It seems obvious that the alliance between the two countries will have a lot of influence on the international situation going forward. In particular, the German government seems to regard the alliance as an alliance to fight against Germany. During World War I, the two formed an alliance against Germany, and the re-established alliance is very stimulating for Germany. Many experts also see it as an alliance against Germany, and this massive event may shake things up in Europe."

 france.10.t:0 "Franco-Italian Alliance"
 france.10.d:0 "This morning, the French-Italian alliance was formed. The two countries share the experience of being defeated disastrously by Germany as Entente during the Great War. The fact that these three countries are again allied means only one thing."

 france.15.t:0 "Southern Uprising"
 france.15.d:0 "Georges Valois, whose whereabouts were unknown, rose, criticizing the current regime, mainly in the southern part of the country. They are the only ones claiming to be legitimate government, and the democrats in Paris accuse them of being traitors."

 france.16.t:0 "French Civil War"
 france.16.d:0 "After weeks of tension, France broke out into a civil war divided into north and south. The world is paying attention to who can be the winner of the civil war, between democrats-led Northern France and fascist-led Southern France. The news of France's civil war may be good news for Germany in the east. Because it can reduce one of their enemies."

 france.24.b:0 "We don't need them."
 france.25.t:0 "Italy's alliance with France"
 france.25.d:0 "Yesterday morning, the Italian government declared an alliance with France.

 france.32.a:0 "Hurrah!"
 france.33.t:0 "France refused"
 france.33.d:0 "France responded lukewarmly to our proposal. They didn't seem to want to join us, and we might have to go our own way."
 france.33.a:0 "Damn it."
 france.34.t:0 "French rejection about the alliance"

 france.46.a:0 "Let's start reconstitution"
 france.47.t:0 "Defense of France"
 france.47.d:0 "The German occupation of Paris shocked many French people, but the soldiers and people of France were not deterred by it. They all remembered the humiliation of Franco-Prussia, and they remembered the humiliation of the last Great War. They could not be defeated again. No matter how hopeless the situation, France would defeat Germany with indomitable will.\n\nThe French government set up a provisional government in Bordeaux, reminding the people that the fall of Paris would in no way mean the end of France.

A breathtaking silence followed for a moment, and at the end of it [FRA.GetLeader] finally opened her mouth.\n"Ladies, in recent months we have had one serious problem, starting with the Treaty of Frankfurt. Alsace-Loren was a French territory. In addition, Nancy was the rightful territory of our French back in recent decades. All the cultural development in the region was that of the French.\nI will enter this war as a nationalist and a French politician. People, I don't think it's right to give in to an oppressor named Germany. As the most French, it is our destiny to fight against the tyranny of the evil Germanic people.\nThose who wish to reject this national mission will disappear in some way. Remember, for a traitor, death is the only thing.\nThe most noble nation, the French, may you win!\n Vive la!""

 france_wr.1.t:0 "Legislative Proposal Announced"
 france_wr.1.d:0 "Within the All-French Popular Union Party, both Jacques Doriot and Marcel Déat have submitted legislative proposals reflecting sharply opposing visions for national governance. With internal leadership tensions now visible, these proposals are seen as more than just policy suggestions—they represent a deeper political confrontation.\n\nAssembly President Déat has introduced a centralized economic plan centered on industrial restructuring and state-directed production, while President Doriot has advocated for a decentralized system based on workers' self-management and cooperative networks. Both sides are appealing to popular support, but factional tensions within the party continue to intensify.\n\nThese bills are expected to be submitted to the legislature shortly and will undergo formal deliberation. The outcomes will likely shape not only the internal balance of power within the National Union but also the future of France's economic and social policy.\n\nThe government has announced that it will handle this matter with political neutrality and in accordance with procedure. Meanwhile, the public watches closely, hoping the clash will produce constructive competition rather than deeper division."
 france_wr.1.a:0 "Roll the dice."
 france_wr.2.t:0 "Industrial Syndicate Act Introduced"
 france_wr.2.d:0 "The 'Industrial Syndicate Act' has been submitted to the legislature. This bill proposes the establishment of tripartite consultative bodies—composed of workers, employers, and the state—within key sectors such as heavy industry, railways, and communications. These bodies would be tasked with coordinating wages, production planning, and employment policies, thereby institutionalizing a corporatist framework.\n\nPresident Doriot strongly supports the bill, calling it a pragmatic solution that promotes popular participation while maintaining state authority and resolving industrial conflicts. In contrast, Assembly President Déat criticizes the proposal for undermining the coherence of national planning and creating what he views as an inefficient system of compromise.\n\nWith both sides firmly entrenched, the outcome of this bill may prove to be a decisive turning point in determining whether Doriot’s corporatist line gains the upper hand."
 france_wr.2.a:0 "Corporatism brings order and unity."  # Doriot's path
 france_wr.2.b:0 "The state must command directly."      # Déat's path
 france_wr.3.t:0 "National Planning Committee Act Introduced"
 france_wr.3.d:0 "The National Assembly of France has received the submission of the 'National Planning Committee Act.' This bill proposes the establishment of a powerful central committee under the authority of the state, tasked with overseeing national production targets, distribution, pricing, and capital flows. The proposed committee is structured as a closed, technocratic body and is regarded as a key instrument in implementing a total planned economy.\n\nAssembly President Déat has voiced strong support for the bill, describing it as a turning point that eliminates capitalist autonomy and outdated interest group interference, while ushering in a regime of scientific and rational control. In contrast, President Doriot has criticized the proposal as a form of elite rule that disregards the will of the people, warning that such bureaucratic centralization deepens the disconnect between the state and the masses.\n\nTechnocratic totalitarianism or popular pragmatism—this debate reaches beyond administrative structure and touches on the very philosophical foundations of national governance."
 france_wr.3.a:0 "Without planning, there is no order."         # Déat's path
 france_wr.3.b:0 "A plan without the people is just dictatorship." # Doriot's path
 france_wr.4.t:0 "National Labor Service Act Introduced"
 france_wr.4.d:0 "The 'National Labor Service Act' has been submitted to the legislature. This bill seeks to introduce a mandatory labor service program for the youth of France, requiring a fixed period of industrial training, civic education, and communal living. Its stated goal is to foster national unity and instill a disciplined work ethic among the next generation.\n\nPresident Doriot has praised the initiative as a 'social military academy' capable of forging new citizens, describing it as a practical measure for unifying the youth and rebuilding the nation. Assembly President Déat has refrained from openly opposing the bill, but close associates have conveyed his reservations—namely, that the politicization and formalization of labor could undermine its actual effectiveness.\n\nMore than an ideological clash, the bill has captured public attention for its symbolic and pragmatic implications. It may well serve as a litmus test for the expanding appeal of Doriot’s brand of nationalist statism."

 france_wr.5.t:0 "Limited Cooperative Autonomy Act Introduced"
 france_wr.5.d:0 "The 'Limited Cooperative Autonomy Act' has been brought before the legislature. The bill would allow, under specific conditions, the creation of autonomous cooperatives at the local and sectoral levels, granting them partial self-governance and tax incentives. However, oversight authority would remain with the state, and the nature and scope of cooperatives would still be coordinated by central planners.\n\nPresident Doriot has expressed his support, calling the bill a framework for 'stable autonomy' that could contribute to social cohesion and regional economic recovery. He emphasized the need to balance popular participation with sufficient oversight to avoid disorder. In contrast, Assembly President Déat has firmly opposed the bill, arguing that the decentralization of cooperatives threatens the coherence of production planning and risks degenerating into unscientific, sentimental localism.\n\nThis legislation has emerged as a clear reflection of the contrasting visions between the two leaders: integration through regulated freedom, or the slippery slope toward fragmentation."
 france_wr.5.a:0 "The people must move within the bounds of control."   # Doriot's path

 france_wr.6.t:0 "Technocratic Certification Act Introduced"
 france_wr.6.d:0 "The 'Technocratic Certification Act' has been submitted to the legislature. The bill proposes to reform the appointment process for senior economic and industrial administrators by replacing political selection with a qualification-based system relying on exams and recommendations. Its stated intent is to institutionalize the role of expert cadres and guide national governance through technical competence rather than ideological allegiance.\n\nAssembly President Déat has hailed the bill as a 'cornerstone of rational governance,' calling it a chance to build a control system grounded not in political emotion but in science and reason. President Doriot, however, responded sharply: “We will not let this nation be ruled by tests and resumes,” warning that the bill risks sidelining the popular will in favor of a rule by specialists.\n\nThe debate surrounding this legislation reveals a deeper conflict between the efficiency of elite rule and the legitimacy of mass representation—one that may determine the very foundation of France’s future governance."
 france_wr.6.a:0 "Competence is the foundation of legitimacy."         # Déat's path

 france_wr.7.t:0 "Public Assembly Reorganization Act Introduced"
 france_wr.7.d:0 "The 'Public Assembly Reorganization Act' proposes the creation of a new advisory body—referred to as the Public Assembly—composed of representatives from industrial syndicates, technical professions, and labor organizations, existing alongside the current legislature. While the proposed body would lack formal legislative authority, it would hold informal deliberative powers over major policy matters.\n\nPresident Doriot has expressed support for the initiative, describing it as a mediating structure that could bridge trust between the people and the state. He argues that institutionalized participation can help consolidate regime legitimacy and absorb popular sentiment. In contrast, Assembly President Déat has strongly opposed the bill, asserting that such corporatized intermediaries threaten the unity and efficiency of a planned economy. “The state,” he reiterated, “must speak with a single voice.”\n\nThe bill poses a deeper question: should the relationship between the state and the people be formalized through structured consultation, or streamlined into strict hierarchy? Once again, the ideological rift between two competing visions of authoritarianism is laid bare."
 france_wr.7.a:0 "A leader must hear the voice of the people."         # Doriot's limited support

 france_wr.8.d_1:0 "The legislative review of six major bills in the National Assembly of France has concluded. As a result, President Jacques Doriot’s platform has secured the upper hand in more than four of the proposals, solidifying his influence within the chamber.\n\nDoriot proposed a decentralized economic structure based on worker self-management and cooperative participation, aiming to promote social cohesion through practical corporatism and mass engagement. In contrast, Assembly President Marcel Déat advocated a centrally planned economy rooted in industrial reorganization and state-directed production, but his vision was criticized as overly ideological and bureaucratic, weakening his position.\n\nThe French state will now be reorganized under Doriot’s populist model of 'integration through order.'"
 france_wr.8.d_2:0 "The legislative review of six major bills in the National Assembly of France has concluded. As a result, more than four proposals aligned with Marcel Déat’s platform have prevailed, marking a clear endorsement of his centralized economic doctrine.\n\nDéat sought to establish a rational and scientific system of governance through full state control over production, distribution, and industrial organization, led by a technocratic elite. President Doriot, on the other hand, promoted corporatist solutions focused on cooperative autonomy and popular participation, but failed to garner support due to concerns over weak coordination and lack of structural coherence.\n\nFrance’s future policies will now be shaped by Déat’s model of 'rational totalitarianism,' underpinned by centralized authority and technocratic planning."
 france_wr.8.d_3:0 "The legislative review of France’s six key bills has ended in a deadlock, with neither side able to secure a majority. President Jacques Doriot and Assembly President Marcel Déat each championed opposing visions for the nation’s future, but failed to gain decisive support from the Assembly.\n\nDoriot proposed a corporatist framework combining centralized planning with mass mobilization, while Déat advocated for a technocratic planned economy and decentralized cooperative structures. But as tensions deepened between the two camps, neither side was able to consolidate enough legislative dominance.\n\nFrance now enters a period of political paralysis, trapped between a fragmented parliament and an unresolved contest for power. A new balance must be found."

 france_wr.9.t:0 "Unity Through Order"
 france_wr.9.d:0 "Chaos, incompetence, and repeated crises have left deep fatigue across French society. Jacques Doriot is emerging as a new alternative to break through this national despair. He advocates a ‘politics of unity’ that transcends ideological divisions between left and right, emphasizing pragmatism and order to reunify a fragmented nation. Under his leadership, the Order Party proposes a new vision of national community built upon syndicalism and ethnic solidarity that goes beyond class lines.\n\nRather than relying on mere slogans, he presents a practical roadmap that breaks away from the outdated frameworks of politics. His popular base, formed around veterans and workers, is gradually expanding into a nationwide movement, grounded in the values of order, responsibility, and unity. Doriot’s rise may mark a turning point for France, signaling a transition away from prolonged chaos and toward a new societal system.\n\nFrance is no longer a country swayed by ideological dogmas. It is preparing to be reborn through the will of its people. As Doriot himself said, true unity can only be achieved through order."

 france_wr.10.t:0 "For the Sake of National Stability"
 france_wr.10.d:0 "France now stands at a critical crossroads. Years of social conflict, political paralysis, and repeated clashes between factions have deeply destabilized the lives of our citizens. Above all, the National Assembly has lost sight of its original purpose, drowning in endless debate and partisan interests, becoming an obstacle rather than a pillar of state governance.\n\nThe government can no longer stand idly by in the face of such irresponsible disorder. As the executive power entrusted with safeguarding public safety and national order, we have made the decision to temporarily suspend the functions of the Assembly and concentrate authority within the government. This is an unavoidable measure to protect the nation in times of crisis, and the first step toward unity and stability grounded in the will of the people.\n\nThis decision does not mark the end of democracy. Rather, it is a rite of passage to preserve the true values of democracy amid chaos. In a state of disorder and division, genuine freedom cannot exist. Only ordered liberty and responsible rights can form the foundation of a sustainable state.\n\nThe government will henceforth take the will of the people to heart, and will pursue all reforms and policies solely in the interest of the nation. France will not return to the chaos of the past. We are moving forward—toward a new era and a new order."

 france_wr.11.t:0 "The Popular Movement Ignites"
 france_wr.11.d:0 "Across France, citizens are rising in response to Doriot’s call, launching a grassroots movement to build a new nation with their own hands. This is more than mere propaganda or expressions of support—this is a genuine and voluntary mobilization of the people, acting and organizing for change.\n\nFrom war veterans and the unemployed to the urban poor, citizens of all backgrounds are rallying under the banner of 'Order and Unity'. This movement is growing into a massive wave that transcends the old political order, generating new national energy and laying the groundwork for France's resurgence.\n\nThe government recognizes the potential of this popular movement and is working to systematically organize and institutionalize its momentum. Doriot has declared that this movement represents 'a nation united by the people, for the people'. What began in the streets is now becoming the very axis of national unity."

 france_wr.12.d:0 "To provide the nation's youth with an opportunity to serve the fatherland, the Doriot government has launched a nationwide youth rally. Across public squares and parks, thousands of young people gather, pledging their dedication and sacrifice to the nation and its people.\n\nThis rally is more than a political ceremony—it is a crucible in which a new generation unites and grows under a shared ideal. Many participants are volunteering for military training, community service, and cooperative initiatives, laying the foundation for a loyal and disciplined society.\n\nThe government intends to cultivate this youth movement into a structured force that reinforces national unity and order. The slogan 'A strong France begins with strong youth' is no longer mere rhetoric—it is becoming the guiding principle of our national revival."

 france_wr.13.t:0 "Institutionalizing the Myth of Degeneration"
 france_wr.13.d:0 "The government has officially codified the moral degeneration of the German people as a civilizational truth and incorporated it as a core tenet of state ideology. The Ministry of Education has distributed new textbooks to all schools nationwide, while existing materials related to German literature and philosophy have been completely discarded. Media and publishing institutions have been reorganized under government supervision, and those who disseminate anti-national content are now subject to legal punishment.\n\nGermans are no longer seen merely as foreign adversaries, but as existential threats to the French spirit. In defense of national dignity, all citizens are now required to internalize the proper historical narrative, considered the foundation of patriotism.

 france_wr.16.d:0 "As part of the government's Southern Industrialization Initiative, large-scale military factories have begun full operations near Toulouse and Marseille. These regions, once reliant on agriculture and maritime trade, are now transforming into strategic hubs to strengthen national security and wartime preparedness.\n\nInitially, the project faced delays due to a shortage of skilled labor and outdated logistics infrastructure. However, thanks to concentrated government investment and labor mobilization, the factories were completed ahead of schedule. Rifles, shells, and ammunition produced here are already being supplied to the northern front, with production lines accelerating daily.\n\nLocal residents are quickly adapting to these changes. Thousands of young people have been assigned to the factories to acquire technical skills, and the participation of female workers is rapidly increasing. Regional newspapers have hailed this as a 'Southern Renaissance of France,' and the central government plans to replicate this model in other rear-area regions.\n\nIn a speech, President Doriot declared, \"France is no longer a passive nation—it is reborn as an industrial power forging its own future with its own hands.\""

 france_wr.17.d:0 "The Valois regime's recently announced policy of 'Expanding Private Property for Farmers' is part of a broader plan to strengthen France's traditional agricultural base and promote a self-reliant rural economy centered around small landowners. Officially, it is framed as a pragmatic effort to increase the independence of the farming class and ensure long-term social stability.\n\nHowever, this policy has drawn fierce opposition from the Doriotist faction, which claims to represent the interests of the urban working class. Jacques Doriot condemned the move as a 'reactionary act that revives the bourgeois illusion of land ownership,' accusing the regime of attempting to return the fruits of collective labor to private hands.\n\nHe declared that 'the regime is using the land question to divide the people,' and argued that the policy is a deliberate attempt to dismantle class solidarity between urban and rural laborers. The Doriotists now view this measure as a dangerous shift in the regime’s direction and have begun preparing for more direct political intervention."

Valois hailed this as the greatest unification in French history, and it appears that France will now enter the war against Germany in a more unified and resolute state."
 france_wr.18.d2:0 "Shortly after the declaration of war against Germany, this morning, the long-feuding factions of Doriot and Bucard—previously under the control of Georges Valois—have decided to form a complete alliance in the face of the immense threat posed by Germany.\n\nThe two factions, often at odds especially over political and economic issues, have chosen to set aside their differences and unite fully in order to confront the German menace. Valois described this as the greatest unification in French history. However, due to the deep-rooted tensions that shaped this alliance, sharp disagreements persist on several key issues.

These statues are not mere sculptures—they are monuments that represent the ideals France aspires to and the origins from which they stem.\n\nSorel emphasized action-oriented socialist ethics, focusing on practice over abstract idealism. Robespierre sought to realize the moral legitimacy of the state in the name of popular sovereignty. Though from different eras, both profoundly shaped the spirit of the French people. In his speech, Georges Valois stated, 'We are building today’s nation upon their ideals, and these statues are not only to honor the past but also to guide us toward the future.'\n\nThe ceremony was attended by numerous prominent figures from all walks of life. With the military band’s performance and thousands of citizens gathered in the square, the event was a moment of shared national pride.

Consequently, a large aid package consisting of military supplies, medical goods, and financial resources has begun its transfer to the nationalist camp in northern Italy.\n\nDomestically, public opinion is divided, but the military and the Ministry of the Interior maintain that 'this is an inevitable step for geopolitical advantage and alliance expansion.' Through this initiative, France appears to be simultaneously preparing for potential conflict with Germany and promoting the expansion of its ideology across Europe.\n\nAs the red shadow looms across the borders, France seeks to project its influence beyond them."

This decision forms part of a long-term strategy to prepare for an inevitable confrontation with Germany, with the French government pursuing this initiative as a pragmatic move in foreign policy.\n\nThe balance of power in Europe is already shifting dramatically, and France requires a strong strategic partner to counter German expansionism. The Soviet, with its vast human and material resources, can play a critical role in containing German forces on the European front.\n\nThrough this contact, France aims to explore opportunities for intelligence sharing, military strategy coordination, and economic cooperation—each of which would provide significant advantages in any future wartime scenario. In particular, if Germany is forced to fight on two fronts, it would offer France a vital strategic buffer for the defense of the homeland.\n\nFurthermore, economic cooperation with the Soviets would allow France to secure essential military resources and diversify its supply lines.

In it, they expressed deep concern about the current state of European affairs and conveyed their intention to pursue diplomatic cooperation with the Soviet government. Specifically, they seek contact for military intelligence sharing, strategic consultations, and economic cooperation.\n\nFrance’s initiative clearly reflects a desire to counter German expansionism. From the Soviet perspective, this is not a proposal to be dismissed lightly. Germany is currently generating tensions on both its eastern and western fronts, and close cooperation with France could significantly increase the strategic burden on the German military.\n\nFurthermore, with the establishment of the National Syndicalist regime in France, an ideological intersection—while far from fully aligned with Leninist principles—has begun to emerge. Within the framework of an anti-German front, there remains ample room for shared strategic interests.\n\nOn the economic front, expanding trade with France could yield considerable benefits for Soviet industry and military production. Securing new supply routes through Western Europe would create a more favorable environment for sustaining the wartime economy.\n\nKremlin advisors have begun reviewing the proposal, and the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs is coordinating an official response. This is not a mere diplomatic gesture. As the geopolitical landscape of Europe is rapidly reshaping, this offer presents us with a new and valuable strategic opportunity."
