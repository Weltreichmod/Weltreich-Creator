 france.1.d:0 "Yesterday morning, French troops marched Champagne and other parts of northeastern France, insisting on the destruction of the Frankfurt Treaty.\n\nGermany's Foreign Ministry has formally protested against France, which has brought the world's attention to Europe.  As a result, the Treaty of Frankfurt was completely destroyed due to this French Republic's declaration of rearmament.\n\nWith this, France is completely out of the shadow of World War I and their anti-German moves are likely to become more active, and France is likely to rearm without any restrictions."

 france.4.t:0 "Catalonia Becomes French Territory"
 france.4.d:0 "There was shocking news this morning. The Spanish government agreed to hand over Catalonia to the French government without any conditions. The Spanish government appears to have succumbed to the military pressure of the past military pressure. Catalonia had long been under the influence of Spain and was briefly occupied by France during the Napoleonic Wars. Under the pretext of this, the French government demanded Catalonia, and Spain, which is experiencing great internal chaos, transferred the territory to France without much resistance."
 france.4.a:0 "Well... It may be the beginning of a terrible thing to come."
 france.5.t:0 "They choose war."

 france.6.d:0 "A military alliance between France and Britain was established this morning. It seems obvious that the alliance between the two countries will have a lot of influence on the international situation going forward. In particular, the German government seems to regard the alliance as an alliance to fight against Germany. During World War I, the two formed an alliance against Germany, and the re-established alliance is very stimulating for Germany. Many experts also see it as an alliance against Germany, and this massive event may shake things up in Europe."

 france.15.t:0 "Southern Uprising"
 france.15.d:0 "Georges Valois, whose whereabouts were unknown, rose, criticizing the current regime, mainly in the southern part of the country. They are the only ones claiming to be legitimate government, and the democrats in Paris accuse them of being traitors."

 france.16.t:0 "French Civil War"
 france.16.d:0 "After weeks of tension, France broke out into a civil war divided into north and south. The world is paying attention to who can be the winner of the civil war, between democrats-led Northern France and fascist-led Southern France. The news of France's civil war may be good news for Germany in the east. Because it can reduce one of their enemies."

 france.24.b:0 "We don't need them."
 france.25.t:0 "Italy's alliance with France"
 france.25.d:0 "Yesterday morning, the Italian government declared an alliance with France. Scholars conjectured that the French-Italian alliance is blatantly targeting German and Austro-Hungarian hegemony.

 france.28.d:0 "His Majesty the King has passed away. Though he had never been in good health since his ascension to the throne, he governed with a single resolve — to break the neck of the German Empire. Yet after our great victory, his weakened body could no longer endure. Shortly after the victory banquet, His Majesty collapsed. The royal physicians made every effort to save him, but for several days he could not leave his bed, and finally, he departed this world in his sleep. Though he ascended the throne at the demand of the Council of Regents, he bore the crown of thorns known as the Second Great War with his own two hands, for the sake of ending the tyranny of the world empire — a testament to the depth of his righteous fury toward the German menace. Foreseeing his fate soon after victory, His Majesty left a final testament to the royal council and to his son, Henri, Count of Paris.\n\n'As head of the House of Orléans and King of France by the grace of God, I solemnly proclaim that my mortal body has reached its end in accordance with the will of Heaven. In this final moment, as my soul ascends to the gates above, I deliver my will to all subjects and ministers.\n\nThe years of discord were but a prologue to this moment. Behold! Germany has fallen, and the arrogance that once trampled Paris has been utterly avenged. The sorrow of twenty years has been repaid with the joy of this triumph. France has risen again, and I, together with my loyal soldiers, passed beneath the Arc de Triomphe as victors — a life’s mission fulfilled.\n\nMy son and my heart, Henri, Count of Paris — you shall now inherit the glorious crown of the French monarchy. You must never lose the virtue and wisdom you have shown: the noble blood of a sovereign and the compassion for your people. Read the tide of the times with clarity, preserve the throne’s role as mediator, and you will have the opportunity to rule by the true royal path. Though my flesh rests, my soul shall remain forever at peace through this great victory. Do not prolong mourning, but take up your duties swiftly — care for the people and secure the peace of the realm.\n\nTo the people of France, I declare — even when I am gone, the glory of France shall endure. It is the destiny forged by the will of the people and ordained by Heaven. Under my heir Henri and the guidance of the Council of Regents, the nation shall prosper and advance. By the sacred laws of the realm, my rightful heir, Henri, Count of Paris, shall bear the lineage and honor of the royal house. I close my eyes in peace, praying for eternal France and the blessing of God.'"

 france_wr.1.t:0 "Legislative Proposal Announced"
 france_wr.1.d:0 "Within the All-French Popular Union Party, both Jacques Doriot and Marcel Déat have submitted legislative proposals reflecting sharply opposing visions for national governance. With internal leadership tensions now visible, these proposals are seen as more than just policy suggestions—they represent a deeper political confrontation.\n\nPrime Minister Déat has introduced a centralized economic plan centered on industrial restructuring and state-directed production, while President Doriot has advocated for a decentralized system based on workers' self-management and cooperative networks. Both sides are appealing to popular support, but factional tensions within the party continue to intensify.\n\nThese bills are expected to be submitted to the legislature shortly and will undergo formal deliberation. The outcomes will likely shape not only the internal balance of power within the National Union but also the future of France's economic and social policy.\n\nThe government has announced that it will handle this matter with political neutrality and in accordance with procedure. Meanwhile, the public watches closely, hoping the clash will produce constructive competition rather than deeper division."
 france_wr.1.a:0 "Roll the dice."
 france_wr.2.t:0 "Industrial Syndicate Act Introduced"
 france_wr.2.d:0 "The 'Industrial Syndicate Act' has been submitted to the legislature. This bill proposes the establishment of tripartite consultative bodies—composed of workers, employers, and the state—within key sectors such as heavy industry, railways, and communications. These bodies would be tasked with coordinating wages, production planning, and employment policies, thereby institutionalizing a corporatist framework.\n\nPresident Doriot strongly supports the bill, calling it a pragmatic solution that promotes popular participation while maintaining state authority and resolving industrial conflicts. In contrast, Prime Minister Déat criticizes the proposal for undermining the coherence of national planning and creating what he views as an inefficient system of compromise.\n\nWith both sides firmly entrenched, the outcome of this bill may prove to be a decisive turning point in determining whether Doriot’s corporatist line gains the upper hand."
 france_wr.2.a:0 "Corporatism brings order and unity."  # Doriot's path
 france_wr.2.b:0 "The state must command directly."      # Déat's path
 france_wr.3.t:0 "National Planning Committee Act Introduced"
 france_wr.3.d:0 "The National Assembly of France has received the submission of the 'National Planning Committee Act.' This bill proposes the establishment of a powerful central committee under the authority of the state, tasked with overseeing national production targets, distribution, pricing, and capital flows. The proposed committee is structured as a closed, technocratic body and is regarded as a key instrument in implementing a total planned economy.\n\nPrime Minister Déat has voiced strong support for the bill, describing it as a turning point that eliminates capitalist autonomy and outdated interest group interference, while ushering in a regime of scientific and rational control. In contrast, President Doriot has criticized the proposal as a form of elite rule that disregards the will of the people, warning that such bureaucratic centralization deepens the disconnect between the state and the masses.\n\nTechnocratic totalitarianism or popular pragmatism—this debate reaches beyond administrative structure and touches on the very philosophical foundations of national governance."
 france_wr.3.a:0 "Without planning, there is no order."         # Déat's path

 france_wr.4.t:0 "National Labor Service Act Introduced"
 france_wr.4.d:0 "The 'National Labor Service Act' has been submitted to the legislature. This bill seeks to introduce a mandatory labor service program for the youth of France, requiring a fixed period of industrial training, civic education, and communal living. Its stated goal is to foster national unity and instill a disciplined work ethic among the next generation.\n\nPresident Doriot has praised the initiative as a 'social military academy' capable of forging new citizens, describing it as a practical measure for unifying the youth and rebuilding the nation. Prime Minister Déat has refrained from openly opposing the bill, but close associates have conveyed his reservations—namely, that the politicization and formalization of labor could undermine its actual effectiveness.\n\nMore than an ideological clash, the bill has captured public attention for its symbolic and pragmatic implications. It may well serve as a litmus test for the expanding appeal of Doriot’s brand of nationalist statism."

 france_wr.5.t:0 "Limited Cooperative Autonomy Act Introduced"
 france_wr.5.d:0 "The 'Limited Cooperative Autonomy Act' has been brought before the legislature. The bill would allow, under specific conditions, the creation of autonomous cooperatives at the local and sectoral levels, granting them partial self-governance and tax incentives. However, oversight authority would remain with the state, and the nature and scope of cooperatives would still be coordinated by central planners.\n\nPresident Doriot has expressed his support, calling the bill a framework for 'stable autonomy' that could contribute to social cohesion and regional economic recovery. He emphasized the need to balance popular participation with sufficient oversight to avoid disorder. In contrast, Prime Minister Déat has firmly opposed the bill, arguing that the decentralization of cooperatives threatens the coherence of production planning and risks degenerating into unscientific, sentimental localism.\n\nThis legislation has emerged as a clear reflection of the contrasting visions between the two leaders: integration through regulated freedom, or the slippery slope toward fragmentation."
 france_wr.5.a:0 "The people must move within the bounds of control."   # Doriot's path

 france_wr.6.t:0 "Technocratic Certification Act Introduced"
 france_wr.6.d:0 "The 'Technocratic Certification Act' has been submitted to the legislature. The bill proposes to reform the appointment process for senior economic and industrial administrators by replacing political selection with a qualification-based system relying on exams and recommendations. Its stated intent is to institutionalize the role of expert cadres and guide national governance through technical competence rather than ideological allegiance.\n\nPrime Minister Déat has hailed the bill as a 'cornerstone of rational governance,' calling it a chance to build a control system grounded not in political emotion but in science and reason. President Doriot, however, responded sharply: "We will not let this nation be ruled by tests and resumes," warning that the bill risks sidelining the popular will in favor of a rule by specialists.\n\nThe debate surrounding this legislation reveals a deeper conflict between the efficiency of elite rule and the legitimacy of mass representation—one that may determine the very foundation of France’s future governance."
 france_wr.6.a:0 "Competence is the foundation of legitimacy."         # Déat's path

 france_wr.7.d:0 "The 'Public Assembly Reorganization Act' proposes the creation of a new advisory body—referred to as the Public Assembly—composed of representatives from industrial syndicates, technical professions, and labor organizations, existing alongside the current legislature. While the proposed body would lack formal legislative authority, it would hold informal deliberative powers over major policy matters.\n\nPresident Doriot has expressed support for the initiative, describing it as a mediating structure that could bridge trust between the people and the state. He argues that institutionalized participation can help consolidate regime legitimacy and absorb popular sentiment. In contrast, Prime Minister Déat has strongly opposed the bill, asserting that such corporatized intermediaries threaten the unity and efficiency of a planned economy. "The state," he reiterated, "must speak with a single voice."\n\nThe bill poses a deeper question: should the relationship between the state and the people be formalized through structured consultation, or streamlined into strict hierarchy? Once again, the ideological rift between two competing visions of authoritarianism is laid bare."

 france_wr.8.d_1:0 "The legislative review of six major bills in the National Assembly of France has concluded. As a result, President Jacques Doriot’s platform has secured the upper hand in more than four of the proposals, solidifying his influence within the chamber.\n\nDoriot proposed a decentralized economic structure based on worker self-management and cooperative participation, aiming to promote social cohesion through practical corporatism and mass engagement. In contrast, Prime Minister Marcel Déat advocated a centrally planned economy rooted in industrial reorganization and state-directed production, but his vision was criticized as overly ideological and bureaucratic, weakening his position.\n\nThe French state will now be reorganized under Doriot’s populist model of 'integration through order.'"
 france_wr.8.d_2:0 "The legislative review of six major bills in the National Assembly of France has concluded. As a result, more than four proposals aligned with Marcel Déat’s platform have prevailed, marking a clear endorsement of his centralized economic doctrine.\n\nDéat sought to establish a rational and scientific system of governance through full state control over production, distribution, and industrial organization, led by a technocratic elite. President Doriot, on the other hand, promoted corporatist solutions focused on cooperative autonomy and popular participation, but failed to garner support due to concerns over weak coordination and lack of structural coherence.\n\nFrance’s future policies will now be shaped by Déat’s model of 'rational totalitarianism,' underpinned by centralized authority and technocratic planning."
 france_wr.8.d_3:0 "The legislative review of France’s six key bills has ended in a deadlock, with neither side able to secure a majority. President Jacques Doriot and Prime Minister Marcel Déat each championed opposing visions for the nation’s future, but failed to gain decisive support from the Assembly.\n\nDoriot proposed a corporatist framework combining centralized planning with mass mobilization, while Déat advocated for a technocratic planned economy and decentralized cooperative structures. But as tensions deepened between the two camps, neither side was able to consolidate enough legislative dominance.\n\nFrance now enters a period of political paralysis, trapped between a fragmented parliament and an unresolved contest for power. A new balance must be found."

 france_wr.9.d:0 "Chaos, incompetence, and repeated crises have left deep fatigue across French society. Jacques Doriot is emerging as a new alternative to break through this national despair. He advocates a ‘politics of unity’ that transcends ideological divisions between left and right, emphasizing pragmatism and order to reunify a fragmented nation. Under his leadership, the Order Party proposes a new vision of national community built upon syndicalism and ethnic solidarity that goes beyond class lines.\n\nRather than relying on mere slogans, he presents a practical roadmap that breaks away from the outdated frameworks of politics. His popular base, formed around veterans and workers, is gradually expanding into a nationwide movement, grounded in the values of order, responsibility, and unity. Doriot’s rise may mark a turning point for France, signaling a transition away from prolonged chaos and toward a new societal system.\n\nFrance is no longer a country swayed by ideological dogmas. It is preparing to be reborn through the will of its people. As Doriot himself said, true unity can only be achieved through order."

 france_wr.10.t:0 "For the Sake of National Stability"
 france_wr.10.d:0 "France now stands at a critical crossroads. Years of social conflict, political paralysis, and repeated clashes between factions have deeply destabilized the lives of our citizens. Above all, the National Assembly has lost sight of its original purpose, drowning in endless debate and partisan interests, becoming an obstacle rather than a pillar of state governance.\n\nThe government can no longer stand idly by in the face of such irresponsible disorder. As the executive power entrusted with safeguarding public safety and national order, we have made the decision to temporarily suspend the functions of the Assembly and concentrate authority within the government. This is an unavoidable measure to protect the nation in times of crisis, and the first step toward unity and stability grounded in the will of the people.\n\nThis decision does not mark the end of democracy. Rather, it is a rite of passage to preserve the true values of democracy amid chaos. In a state of disorder and division, genuine freedom cannot exist. Only ordered liberty and responsible rights can form the foundation of a sustainable state.\n\nThe government will henceforth take the will of the people to heart, and will pursue all reforms and policies solely in the interest of the nation. France will not return to the chaos of the past. We are moving forward—toward a new era and a new order."

This is more than mere propaganda or expressions of support—this is a genuine and voluntary mobilization of the people, acting and organizing for change.\n\nFrom war veterans and the unemployed to the urban poor, citizens of all backgrounds are rallying under the banner of 'Order and Unity'. This movement is growing into a massive wave that transcends the old political order, generating new national energy and laying the groundwork for France's resurgence.\n\nThe government recognizes the potential of this popular movement and is working to systematically organize and institutionalize its momentum. Doriot has declared that this movement represents 'a nation united by the people, for the people'. What began in the streets is now becoming the very axis of national unity."

 france_wr.12.d:0 "To provide the nation's youth with an opportunity to serve the fatherland, the Doriot government has launched a nationwide youth rally. Across public squares and parks, thousands of young people gather, pledging their dedication and sacrifice to the nation and its people.\n\nThis rally is more than a political ceremony—it is a crucible in which a new generation unites and grows under a shared ideal. Many participants are volunteering for military training, community service, and cooperative initiatives, laying the foundation for a loyal and disciplined society.\n\nThe government intends to cultivate this youth movement into a structured force that reinforces national unity and order. The slogan 'A strong France begins with strong youth' is no longer mere rhetoric—it is becoming the guiding principle of our national revival."

 france_wr.13.d:0 "The government has officially codified the moral degeneration of the German people as a civilizational truth and incorporated it as a core tenet of state ideology. The Ministry of Education has distributed new textbooks to all schools nationwide, while existing materials related to German literature and philosophy have been completely discarded. Media and publishing institutions have been reorganized under government supervision, and those who disseminate anti-national content are now subject to legal punishment.\n\nGermans are no longer seen merely as foreign adversaries, but as existential threats to the French spirit. In defense of national dignity, all citizens are now required to internalize the proper historical narrative, considered the foundation of patriotism. French government has made it clear that these measures are a necessary step for the survival of the state, and the people have responded with duty and loyalty."

 france_wr.14.d:0 "Under the leadership of the government, labor unions scattered across various industries are being reorganized into a single unified structure. Independent unions by sector have voluntarily dissolved, and all workers are now affiliated with the 'Union Nationale Intégrée', pledging cooperation with the state's economic plans and policies.\n\nWhile some hardline union factions have voiced opposition, the majority of the population supports the government's efforts to protect workers’ rights while promoting social harmony. The unified union is expected to become not just a representative body but a central pillar of the new economic order.\n\nA government spokesperson hailed the measure as 'the beginning of a new era of genuine cooperation between labor and the state.'"

However, the newly established Coordination Committee swiftly intervened, and both sides reached an agreement through mutual concessions.\n\nThis incident has become a symbolic example of the committee’s necessity and effectiveness. Both the public and the industrial sector now express hopes that this mediation body will help prevent larger conflicts in the future."

 france_wr.16.t:0 "Déat's New Order"
 france_wr.16.d:0 "At the heart of French society, a new ideological current known as the 'New Order' is steadily gaining influence. Marcel Déat, once a theorist discussed only among certain intellectuals and bureaucratic circles, is now drawing attention in the upper ranks of the political establishment, civil service, and even the military.\n\nHis writings and doctrines are quietly circulating and earning respect. His vision of 'Total Socialism,' a technocratic planned state, and the 'depoliticization of governance' resonates deeply with those disillusioned by the current political system. Particularly among those wearied by partisan fragmentation and irresponsible populism, Déat's blueprint for a disciplined and orderly nation has begun to find serious consideration.\n\nThis shift goes beyond ideological sympathy—it is beginning to manifest structurally beneath the surface. Young elite administrators and technically trained experts are increasingly falling under Déat’s intellectual orbit. Reports suggest that in some ministries, informal policy advisory networks are already coalescing around his ideas.\n\nAlthough President Doriot remains formally in power, his foundations are gradually weakening. The press has yet to publicize this undercurrent, but within political circles, it is becoming clear that Déat’s ideology is rising as a new center of authority. This quiet transformation may soon serve as a decisive turning point in the French political landscape."

The bill passed through the proper legislative procedures and was enacted without delay. Upon its promulgation, all political party activities were officially banned. Administrative enforcement has been uniformly carried out across party headquarters and local branches, and legal action against key party figures has been promptly undertaken in accordance with the law. In some regions, there were localized expressions of dissent; however, public security and enforcement units responded on-site and resolved the situation without major conflict. This measure does not target any particular faction but represents a structural decision to reorganize the broader political landscape and ensure greater administrative cohesion and efficiency. The assets of the dissolved parties are now under state supervision and will be managed in accordance with public needs. The entire process is proceeding as planned, and there has been no significant disruption to the daily lives of citizens."

 france_wr.18.d:0 "To ensure industrial stability and maintain administrative consistency, the government has introduced legislation to dismantle the current trade union structure. The bill passed through parliamentary review and was enacted without delay, initiating a full-scale implementation of dissolution measures. Major trade union headquarters and branch offices across the country have been closed in accordance with the new legal framework. In some areas, attempts at building occupations and protest gatherings occurred. In response, militia units and law enforcement were deployed to the scenes and peacefully dispersed all such activities. The government emphasizes that this action does not deny the fundamental rights of workers, and a new consultative mechanism is being prepared to support constructive industrial dialogue. Legal procedures involving union leadership are currently underway, and the overall implementation of the policy will proceed without exception. The atmosphere remains calm nationwide, and industrial operations continue without interruption."

 france_wr.19.d:0 "This morning, a historic ceremony was held in a central square of Paris. A statue honoring Maximilien Robespierre—the symbol of the French Revolution and the embodiment of the nation’s moral will—was officially unveiled. This statue is not merely a monument; it was conceived as a symbol of the ideals France upholds and the origins from which they sprang.\n\nRobespierre sought to realize the moral legitimacy of the state in the name of popular sovereignty. In his speech, the Mayor of Paris declared, 'We are building today’s nation upon their ideals, and this statue is not just a tribute to the past but a milestone for moving forward.'\n\nNumerous prominent figures from various sectors attended the event. Accompanied by a military band, thousands of citizens gathered in the square, sharing a collective sense of national pride. His figure now stands upon the path of France—not simply a shape of stone and iron, but a torch of spirit reminding us of where we come from and where we must go."

 france_wr.20.d:0 "The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently dispatched a diplomatic delegation to our government, proposing unofficial talks aimed at strengthening strategic cooperation within Europe. The French side expressed its desire to establish a 'trustworthy partnership to navigate uncertain times together.'\n\nWhile the proposal is officially framed around expanding economic and security cooperation, it is clear that France seeks to counter the growing influence of Germany and Austria. France sees us as a strategic balancing force between Eastern and Central Europe and hopes that Italy will join them in shaping a new European order.\n\nThis diplomatic overture has been welcomed by factions aligned with National Syndicalism, but elements within the military and conservative circles have raised concerns about excessive French involvement in our affairs. Our decision now will shape the direction of our foreign policy in the critical days ahead."

This signifies more than a simple exchange of diplomacy — it marks a new turning point in restoring strategic trust and strengthening cooperation between our two nations. The agreement lays the groundwork for deeper collaboration not only in political consensus but also in economic and military interests, enabling both countries to pursue a shared long-term vision.\n\nThe French government views this as an opportunity to further solidify its diplomatic standing within Europe, and cooperation with Italy will serve as a strategic counterbalance to the growing influence of Germany and Austria. In particular, the ideological alignment around national syndicalism represents more than a mere alliance — it is expected to play a pivotal role in reshaping Europe's political landscape.\n\nThis diplomatic breakthrough stands as proof of the consistency and effectiveness of our foreign strategy. Moving forward, we will continue to expand our ideals and influence across Europe through similar strategic partnerships."
 france_wr.21.a:0 "A wise decision."
 france_wr.22.t:0 "Diplomatic Proposal Rejected"
 france_wr.22.d:0 "Italy has responded to our diplomatic proposal with a cautious yet firm rejection. Our offer to strengthen strategic cooperation was declined on the grounds that it 'does not align with Italy's national interest and sovereignty.' The Italian government emphasized the need to focus on internal affairs and expressed concern that accepting foreign involvement might spark unnecessary tensions.\n\nThis decision is considered a painful diplomatic setback for the French government and may cause some disruption in our broader geopolitical strategy within Europe. We had hoped Italy would serve as a partner to counter the growing influence of Germany and Austria, but this refusal means we must now reevaluate our strategic balance.\n\nDomestically, the rejection has raised criticism over the limits of France's diplomatic influence, and some voices have begun to question Italy's true intentions. Nevertheless, the government has stated it does not see this development as a final failure, but rather as an opportunity to reassess and improve our long-term diplomatic approach. Europe's political landscape remains fluid, and France must now seek new alliances from a position of renewed resolve."

The era of fierce conflict among ideologies and factions has now passed. What matters is no longer who has triumphed, but the fact that France must stand united as one and march toward the future.\n\nIn the capital, Paris, mass gatherings and ceremonies were held as delegates from across the country assembled to affirm the new order and pledge themselves before the people. The streets were awash with national flags, and hope once more shone upon the faces of the citizens. Some called for the rebirth of the Republic, others praised order and tradition, while still others emphasized revolution and social justice—but all voices carried the same determination: to rebuild France.\n\nFrom this day forward, France shall no longer remain shackled by the shadows of the past.

This decision forms part of a long-term strategy to prepare for an inevitable confrontation with Germany, with the French government pursuing this initiative as a pragmatic move in foreign policy.\n\nThe balance of power in Europe is already shifting dramatically, and France requires a strong strategic partner to counter German expansionism. The Soviet, with its vast human and material resources, can play a critical role in containing German forces on the European front.\n\nThrough this contact, France aims to explore opportunities for intelligence sharing, military strategy coordination, and economic cooperation—each of which would provide significant advantages in any future wartime scenario. In particular, if Germany is forced to fight on two fronts, it would offer France a vital strategic buffer for the defense of the homeland.\n\nFurthermore, economic cooperation with the Soviets would allow France to secure essential military resources and diversify its supply lines. This will serve as a crucial foundation for sustaining the war effort in the long term."

In it, they expressed deep concern about the current state of European affairs and conveyed their intention to pursue diplomatic cooperation with the Soviet government. Specifically, they seek contact for military intelligence sharing, strategic consultations, and economic cooperation.\n\nFrance’s initiative clearly reflects a desire to counter German expansionism. From the Soviet perspective, this is not a proposal to be dismissed lightly. Germany is currently generating tensions on both its eastern and western fronts, and close cooperation with France could significantly increase the strategic burden on the German military.\n\nFurthermore, with the establishment of the National Syndicalist regime in France, an ideological intersection—while far from fully aligned with Leninist principles—has begun to emerge. Within the framework of an anti-German front, there remains ample room for shared strategic interests.\n\nOn the economic front, expanding trade with France could yield considerable benefits for Soviet industry and military production. Securing new supply routes through Western Europe would create a more favorable environment for sustaining the wartime economy.\n\nKremlin advisors have begun reviewing the proposal, and the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs is coordinating an official response. This is not a mere diplomatic gesture. As the geopolitical landscape of Europe is rapidly reshaping, this offer presents us with a new and valuable strategic opportunity."

More importantly, this agreement sends a clear signal to the nations of Europe that France is not isolated on the international stage.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is already preparing the first working-level meetings, where the concrete framework for military strategy and intelligence sharing will be discussed.

As the threat of conflict with Germany looms, securing a strong eastern partner was a critical strategic goal. This outcome raises worries about potential diplomatic isolation.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement asserting, "We will mobilize all available means to reshape the strategic balance in Europe.

All educational, media, and administrative institutions will be reorganized around this ideological foundation. The government explained that this measure is necessary to achieve ‘ideological coherence among the people, uniformity in education, and clarity of political purpose,’ and to overcome internal division caused by pluralism.\n\nConsequently, activities that promote ideological confusion or support alternative belief systems are prohibited.

Disputes will be mediated through sectoral councils, while a central coordinating body will make final decisions.\n\nThe government declared that this structure aims to ‘mediate class conflict and achieve both productivity and social unity.’ Mandatory syndicates will be established across all sectors of the economy. The existing market-based autonomous structure will be gradually dismantled, paving the way for a state-coordinated economic framework.\n\nThis reform is justified on the grounds of protecting small businesses, stabilizing wages, and increasing industrial efficiency. All enterprises will be required to register with their respective industrial syndicates.

Public education, media, and the arts will accordingly enhance mandatory instruction and promotion of France’s national identity.\n\nFurthermore, the legal status of national symbols—such as the flag, anthem, and language—will be strengthened. The clause also includes provisions for the protection of French citizens living abroad. Conversely, ideologies or actions deemed to undermine the national identity will be subject to legal restrictions, and the nationality law will be reinforced.\n\nPresident Doriot concluded his address by stating, "We are one people, one nation, one France," calling on all citizens to take pride in being part of this new era."

Below them, production targets from the previous day are displayed on a board, and any group that failed to meet its quota averts its gaze in silence.\n\nPolitical police officers, marked by red armbands, watch over the workers throughout the shift. Propagandists repeat revolutionary slogans through loudspeakers, and even during short breaks, the workers remain under scrutiny. Mistakes invite suspicion, and suspicion can lead to investigation—or imprisonment. Fear hangs over the factory floor, but production does not halt.\n\nNo one dares to voice dissent. In the face of the greater cause—building the Socialist France—personal discomfort is a luxury no one can afford. Workers move like cogs in a great machine, hands tirelessly pushing through their quotas. Meals are rationed and simple, served on metal trays. Names of exemplary workers are posted on the board of honor, while underperformers quietly vanish or fail to return the next day.\n\nThe entire process is governed with precision. The 'Complete Neo-Socialist Economy' transcends individual will in favor of collective efficiency. At its core are the thousands of workers who have become the very gears of the factory. Their labor transforms into rifles and cannons—the tools that shall one day rebuild France.

Those who have upheld discipline on the frontlines and obeyed orders may now become the pillars that will restore the Republic.\n\nGeneral Charles de Gaulle and Monsieur François de La Rocque have quietly emerged onto the political stage. One is a general who champions honor and the independence of the army, the other a symbol of civic order who has led mass movements and paramilitary formations. Their arrival signifies more than just support—it is a ‘declaration by the military’ to restore the nation, and perhaps even the arrival of a new force to replace the feeble politics of old.\n\nToday, we have entered into an agreement with these two men, placing the military's loyalty upon a political foundation. For the sake of public security, for the restoration of order, and to put an end to the anarchic state that threatens our homeland. In a public statement, they pledged to the nation: 'We shall be the sword and shield of France.'\n\nIn response, discussions have begun regarding the introduction of political officers into military units.

A full-scale purge has been carried out against military officers and civilian advisors aligned with the Order Republican Party.

Countless documents have been destroyed, slogans replaced, and military education programs thoroughly restructured.\n\nAt the same time, the introduction of the political commissar system is now fully underway.

Headquarters are no longer politically neutral spaces; every unit is now treated as a political entity.\n\nFollowing the purge, some senior officers have resigned, while others have been quietly arrested and are currently under investigation. The people observe this transformation in silence, and some newspapers have already begun calling it ‘a new direction for the military.’\n\nThe military is no longer simply a force of arms.

Liberal parliamentarianism, he argued, had failed to ensure the people's stability and survival, while Marxism had brought only endless division and civil war. France, he said, had found salvation in neither path.\n\nTo respond to this impasse, Déat declared that a new political ideology, 'Neo-Socialism', would form the core of the nation. This is not a revolution of violence or fragmented reform, but a 'constructive revolution'—led by a strong state and guided by cooperation between the government and technical experts to drive orderly planning and production. Déat announced plans to revise the constitution to establish a system where the state could coordinate and lead society as a whole.\n\nAt the heart of the reform is a significant expansion of presidential power and the creation of a 'National Council' to replace the existing parliament. This council would include representatives from trade unions, technocrats, and industry, participating directly in national planning and bearing responsibility for livelihoods and production. In addition, all political party activity would be severely restricted, marking the end of the divisive political system of the past.\n\nFinally, Déat emphasized that this was not a simple power grab, but a 'necessary and moral responsibility' to restore order and rebuild France. He concluded that a society where no one goes hungry, where people can work and plan for the future, is the vision of Neo-Socialism and the new path for the French nation."

This marks the central doctrine of Neo-Socialism and the new direction for France.\n\nArticle I of the draft declares France to be a 'planned state founded on labor, technology, and order,' assigning the state responsibility for maintaining harmony across all sectors of the economy and society. Article II establishes the 'National Council' as the supreme authority combining legislative and executive powers, composed of representatives from labor unions, technical organizations, and industrial sectors.\n\nPolitical parties are strictly limited. Article III stipulates that party registration and activities will be tightly regulated by the state, described as a measure to protect the people from political fragmentation. All citizens, regardless of class or origin, are to be granted equal rights and social duties, and labor is defined as the highest form of devotion to the nation.\n\nThis constitution is not merely an institutional reform—it functions as a manifesto to reconstruct the shattered state and endow it with a new sense of national unity.

Marcel Déat hailed this clause as the spiritual pillar of the new France, stating that the constitution itself will serve as a declaration of the people’s historical victory.\n\nThe inclusion of this revolutionary legacy bestows both legitimacy and moral clarity upon the neo-socialist regime, tying the present directly to the struggles of the past."

These contributions may take the form of military service, social welfare work, or technical and industrial service. This formalizes the core neo-socialist principle that 'labor is the highest form of civic service.'\n\nThis clause is not simply a mandate for service but a declaration of a renewed social contract between the individual and the state.

At the center of the controversy lie the so-called 'Six Core Bills,' which contain major reforms that would restructure key areas such as the distribution of power, industrial control, military organization, educational reform, religious regulation, and media oversight.\n\nMarcel Déat adheres to a direction that strengthens state-led planned economy and technocratic governance, focusing each bill on codifying and institutionalizing a neo-socialist order. In contrast, Doriot favors a more popular and action-oriented form of control, opposes the unification of state apparatuses, and insists on preserving the autonomy of military and labor organizations.\n\nThe problem is that both sides have secured strong support within the Assembly. Every vote ends in a tie, and each delegation in the National Council remains split, preventing the passage of even a single bill. As national governance grinds to a halt, discontent is growing in both industry and the military. The press has labeled this situation 'the first political impasse created by the People's Union.'\n\nSome voices are calling for mediated compromises through negotiation, but both sides maintain that ideological concessions are unacceptable. As such, a short-term compromise appears unlikely. This situation is exposing deep fissures within the popular socialist regime, and concerns are rising that unless one side decisively seizes the initiative, the French State may sink deeper into political chaos."

 france_wr.78.d:0 "The French State is now mired in severe turmoil. With legislative deadlock between Marcel Déat and Jacques Doriot dragging on, the Assembly has become paralyzed, unable to pass a single law. This political vacuum is spreading administrative disorder across the board, while public distrust and exhaustion are approaching a critical threshold.\n\nSeizing the opportunity, various political forces have begun to move once more in the shadows. In major cities, radical socialist factions and anarchist groups are inciting protests, while in rural regions, traditionalist militias and local anti-government elements are reportedly attempting to seize control over village-level authority.\n\nThe press has warned that "the heart of the nation is trembling," and even within the bureaucracy and labor unions, growing criticism suggests that the ongoing impasse is eroding the regime’s legitimacy. Once unified under the banner of revolution, the French State now finds itself facing internal fractures that threaten to tear it apart."

 france_wr.79.d:0 "The All-French Popular Union is rapidly losing influence due to internal divisions and growing accusations of responsibility for governmental paralysis. As the party’s central authority weakens, various suppressed political groups have begun to stir beneath the surface.\n\nOn the outskirts of cities and in industrial zones, long-forgotten socialist factions are rallying once more under their old banners, while conservative civic organizations are expanding their presence in suburban areas. Underground newspapers, factional cells within trade unions, and student councils are each raising their voices in different ways, calling for a reassessment of the current regime.\n\nThough these changes remain quiet on the surface, they are slowly fracturing the political landscape of the French State. No open conflicts have yet erupted, but groups with divergent visions for the future are beginning to emerge clearly, drawing invisible lines of confrontation.\n\n§RIf a specific party's influence exceeds 50% and it is the most influential among all parties, that party will seize power. If no such party emerges, the political deadlock will continue indefinitely.§!"

 france_wr.80.d:0 "The political scene of the French State is sinking deeper into a quagmire of division. Marcel Déat and Jacques Doriot, once joint leaders of the revolution, have now completely lost trust in each other and are locked in a direct confrontation over the nation's future.\n\nA recent session of the National Council once again collapsed over the debate surrounding the so-called 'Six Core Bills,' with both sides accusing the other of being 'counter-revolutionary and totalitarian.' Déat advocates for a technocratic planned economy and strong centralized control, declaring that 'freedom without order is the enemy of the people.' Doriot counters with a populist emphasis on autonomy and action-based politics, arguing that 'the people cannot be imprisoned in the bureaucratic cage.'\n\nTheir conflict has transcended mere policy disagreements and evolved into an ideological struggle over the direction of the regime and the legitimacy of power. Their respective supporters are already clashing in ministries, the military, trade unions, and local administrations. In some areas, public services have come to a halt, and chains of command are becoming duplicated.\n\nThis political deadlock has now escalated into a full-blown systemic crisis. The French State stands at a crossroads: will it collapse from within, or will it overcome this turmoil and forge a new order?"

 france_wr.81.t:0 "In the Name of Reason"
 france_wr.81.d:0 "Marcel Déat delivered a scathing critique of Jacques Doriot in a recent public address. He denounced Doriot as 'an anti-intellectual populist hiding behind the banner of revolution,' accusing him of turning the suffering of the people into political capital.\n\n'We have endured and worked tirelessly to build a new order after the revolution. But there are those who seek to tear it down, relying solely on emotions and slogans to solve complex problems.'\n\nDéat specifically condemned Doriot's recent initiatives, such as expanding autonomous organizations and mobilizing military and labor unions, labeling them as 'chaotic excesses' that only lead to a new form of concentrated power under the guise of freedom.\n\nHe argued, 'Bureaucracy may have its flaws, but freedom without structure leads to destruction.' Emphasizing that the state must be governed by reason rather than sentiment, Déat’s speech was met with applause from technocrats and state planning advocates, but sparked backlash from grassroots activists.\n\nAs the political deadlock drags on, the rhetoric on both sides has grown increasingly hostile. Déat’s speech, delivered in the name of reason, amounted to a declaration of ideological war against the Doriot faction."

 france_wr.82.d:0 "Jacques Doriot, during a recent rally with youth leaders from the trade unions, launched a direct attack on Marcel Déat. He denounced Déat’s policies as 'the fantasies of a bureaucrat that only function on dead pages of planning documents,' questioning the meaning of a state without its people.\n\n'The state is not something that merely exists—it must live and breathe. Control and design untouched by the people's breath are no different from dictatorship.'\n\nDoriot sharply criticized Déat’s proposed education reforms and media oversight systems, calling them 'textbooks of ideological imposition and enforced silence'—a betrayal of the revolutionary ideals they once shared.\n\n'We did not fight to raise a new tyrant. No justification can be used to suppress the autonomy and actions of the people,' he proclaimed, warning that Déat’s so-called 'Neo-Socialist state model' could usher in a second age of despotism.\n\nHis speech was met with roaring applause from the young activists and union leaders in attendance, and reports indicate Doriot is preparing for a nationwide speaking tour to build on this momentum. The political divide has now escalated beyond ideological disputes—it is a battle over legitimacy itself."

While national plans drift aimlessly and legislation stagnates in parliament, public trust has rapidly eroded. Doriot continues to speak of the 'will of the people,' but his inner circle is filled with inept aides and opportunists, and true leadership is nowhere to be found.\n\nIn this climate, Marcel Bucard and his Francist organization have begun to move. Under the banner of 'national reconstruction,' they demand the resignation of Doriot’s regime, calling for the restoration of order and efficient governance. Francist paramilitaries have gathered on the outskirts of Paris and are swiftly reorganizing, coordinating with conservative military officers to finalize plans for a 'march of liberation.'\n\nIn a fiery speech, Bucard declared, \"The nation moves not with slogans, but with resolve. We can no longer leave this country in the hands of irresponsible agitators,\" condemning the Doriot regime as a 'deceptive people's dictatorship.' His words have been met with enthusiasm from business circles, the conservative press, and pragmatists within the army, many of whom now see the Francist advance as France’s last hope.\n\nParis remains quiet for now, but cracks are forming. Bucard’s chosen path may well lead the nation into yet another civil war."

National planning is stagnant, the administration is paralyzed by ideological strife, and the people have lost faith in their leadership. Amid this chaos, Marcel Bucard and the Francists have made their move under the banner of 'restoring order.'\n\nBucard has recently maintained secret contact with elements of the hardline conservative officer corps and pragmatic factions within the military. United in their opposition to populist agitation and ideological gridlock, they have chosen to align with the Francists to bring the current regime to an end. Under the justification of 'saving the nation,' they are discreetly preparing a military intervention and the occupation of Paris.\n\nThe Francist paramilitary units have begun advancing toward the outskirts of the capital, while supplies and troops are being repositioned under the pretense of a 'security operation.' The objective is clear: the dismantling of the Doriot regime and the establishment of a new, powerful national order.\n\nIn a recent speech, Bucard declared, "We shall reclaim our nation. The army will no longer feign neutrality. France is ready to act." While Paris remains calm on the surface, the sound of marching boots is growing louder beneath. The advance has already begun."

What began on the outskirts of the city quickly escalated into clashes in the urban center. While some police units and citizen militias attempted to resist, the Francist–military alliance, equipped with heavy weaponry, rapidly seized key administrative buildings.\n\nDoriot himself has vanished without making a public statement, and his cabinet has effectively disintegrated. Several ministers have reportedly been arrested, while others are said to be preparing for exile. The National Assembly is now under military control, and the Francists are preparing to declare the formation of a provisional government.\n\nAt noon, Marcel Bucard addressed a crowd assembled in front of the Élysée Palace, proclaiming, "France shall rise again. The age of incompetence and chaos is over." He announced the foundation of a new regime based on order, national unity, and effective governance, and signaled the start of state reconstruction and internal purges.\n\nParis is currently under martial law.

This institution will be tasked with safeguarding law and order across all aspects of society, preemptively suppressing chaos, crime, and anti-government activity.\n\nMarcel Bucard has entrusted this critical institution to a man in whom he places the utmost confidence. Joseph Darnand, a veteran of the Great War known for his discipline and loyalty, has been appointed as the Bureau’s first director. Above all, he is a man driven by a conviction to rescue France from turmoil.\n\nWhile the Bureau has yet to begin full-scale operations, the government repeatedly emphasizes that its sole purpose is the safety and order of the citizenry. Nevertheless, murmurs of a 'quiet reshuffle' have begun to circulate among officials and the press, and the full extent of the Bureau’s mandate remains uncertain."

As he gazed at the flickering city lights outside, he quietly pondered his thoughts. France, he believed, is a nation that has cultivated one of the world’s greatest civilizations, and its true masters must never forget that this land belongs, above all, to the French people.\n\nNow is the time to make a decision. To revive a homeland that has long suffered in division and chaos, France must reclaim its true identity and its rightful strength. Monsieur Bucard solemnly vowed—both to himself and before history—that he shall rebuild a France for the French.\n\nIn his view, the era of corrupt parliamentarianism, foreign interference, and impotent party politics must now come to an end. What the nation requires is not compromise, but true governance—leadership grounded in the unity of people, state, and homeland. Of course, the road ahead shall not be easy. There will be no shortage of condemnation from abroad and resistance within, and countless obstacles are sure to await.\n\nBut he understands this well: it takes the unwavering resolve of a single determined leader to guide millions, and even the harshest path can lead to the restoration of national dignity. As the twilight deepens, Marcel Bucard quietly closes the window and once again renews his vow."

 france_wr.89.d:0 "In a closed-door session held at the Élysée Palace, Marcel Bucard convened with the leaders of France's major corporations. This was no mere economic discussion—it marked a political initiative to redefine the relationship between the Francist state and industrial power under the emerging national order.\n\nBucard emphasized that in order for France to embark on a new path of unity and strength, the corporate world must contribute to the cause of national reconstruction. He demanded both loyalty to the state and the assumption of greater social responsibility from the industrial elite. Many corporate representatives expressed general agreement and pledged to follow the government's direction.\n\nExecutives from major corporations in the steel, mechanical, and infrastructure sectors promised to participate in forthcoming state-directed projects. In exchange, the government is expected to provide targeted tax incentives and administrative support. With the interests of state and capital increasingly aligned, observers expect a new framework of cooperation to solidify rapidly.\n\nWhile some commentators have raised concerns over the potential loss of independence for the private sector, the regime insists this meeting was strictly about securing national stability through mutual effort. This initiative is likely to reduce uncertainty and strengthen the economic foundations upon which France can rise again.\n\nThe Republic now moves forward under a unified purpose, with the state and corporations marching together toward the future."

 france_wr.90.t:0 "A New Chapter in Labor Relations"
 france_wr.90.d:0 "In an effort to resolve widespread instability across the industrial sector and reestablish order in the labor market, the government has entered into direct negotiations with representatives of major corporations. These talks have deliberately excluded existing labor unions, based on the government's assessment that union activity has become excessively ideological and politicized, to the detriment of the national economy.\n\nOfficials have indicated that this measure is not temporary. Rather, it marks the beginning of a structural shift toward a state-directed framework for labor dialogue. The role of independent unions will be gradually diminished, to be replaced by 'cooperative organizations' operating under official supervision and sanction.\n\nThis change represents more than a mere administrative adjustment. It aims to simultaneously achieve higher productivity, greater national cohesion, and the containment of communist agitation. Naturally, segments of the labor movement have decried the decision as an infringement on freedom of association, and some intellectuals have warned of a creeping silencing of the working class.\n\nNonetheless, the government has reaffirmed its position in a quiet but resolute tone: what the nation requires at this moment is not idealism, but order. National stability and the livelihood of the people must take precedence over all else."

 france_wr.91.t:0 "The Spread of Nationalist Historiography"
 france_wr.91.d:0 "The French government has recently adopted a 'nationalist view of history' as an official state ideology, aiming to reaffirm national identity and pursue a campaign of moral rearmament. This new historical narrative reinterprets France's past wars not as mere political clashes or pragmatic decisions, but as noble sacrifices made for the survival and glory of the nation. Through this, the government seeks to reshape the national consciousness of its people.\n\nA complete overhaul of school textbooks is underway to ensure that the younger generation repeatedly learns of the nation's past glories and trials. Simultaneously, a comprehensive propaganda effort is being conducted via radio broadcasts, newspapers, cinemas, and public posters, encouraging all French citizens to take pride in the hardships their country has endured. Key figures and events are being deliberately emphasized or glorified, fostering a sense that the struggle for the nation is not a personal burden, but a sacred and honorable duty.\n\nThis new historiographical framework is expected to serve as a powerful force for unity and resistance, especially in times of foreign invasion or existential threat to the Republic. Citizens will be encouraged to view the cost in human lives not as a tragedy, but as a solemn act of devotion to the nation. In cases where vital territory is lost, such losses will be met with renewed patriotic fervor and righteous indignation. The government believes that this nationalist spiritual mobilization will serve as a crucial psychological and political foundation for France's diplomatic and military efforts in the years to come."

 france_wr.92.d:0 ""Do not stop your hands. You are working for France."—this is the phrase most commonly heard in the factories these days. At 6 AM, workers arrive in the darkened loading docks, and it isn’t until 10 PM that the final assembly lines fall silent. The state declares a doctrine of 'national salvation through labor,' and workplaces that fail to meet production targets face warnings and constant supervision.\n\nThe Marcel Bucard government brands this policy as 'devotion to the nation,' coordinating work intensity through satellite unions in each workplace. But the reality on the ground is far from ideal. Break times have been shortened, safety standards are largely symbolic, and it is the workers—not the machines—that break down first.\n\nPublic radio boasts of France’s industrial revival and restored global competitiveness, but on the shop floor, workers labor in silence, indistinguishable from the very machines they serve. Among them, a bitter joke circulates: "We don’t wear blue shirts—we wear blackened blood."\n\nThe regime continues to emphasize stability and productivity, and is reportedly tightening surveillance on union figures who display signs of dissent. Whether this policy is truly a path toward national recovery, or merely meaningless overwork dressed in the name of reconstruction, remains uncertain."

 france_wr.93.d:0 "The Army General Staff has recently issued Order No. 14 to all divisions, mandating the implementation of a new 'National Spirit Education' program for all soldiers. This initiative, in addition to conventional military training, aims to instill a repeated and unwavering belief in France’s glorious history and the sacred duty of the nation.\n\nSoldiers now participate in nationalist lectures and oath recitals every morning before drill and again after evening roll call. In some units, these ideological sessions have even taken precedence over firearms instruction. Political officers assigned to each regiment stress that 'the French soldier is not merely a fighter, but a warrior of the nation's soul,' calling for a fundamental transformation in the identity of the military man.\n\nObservers note that this development marks more than a shift in training methods — it is shaping a new spiritual order within the military itself. Slogans such as 'it is not training or arms, but our national mission that dispels fear in battle' are spreading naturally among the troops. Reports from recent field exercises indicate a noticeable rise in morale and resolve.\n\nThe General Staff has welcomed these changes, declaring that 'to overcome the decadence of liberal nihilism and forge a new France unified in will, the military must become the spiritual backbone of the nation.' The French bayonet, they claim, is no longer forged merely of steel, but of belief and history alike."

It is a nation bound by blood, tradition, language, and conviction. When we forget who we are, that is the very moment when the state dies. Now, we must reclaim what is ours—our roots, our name, and our destiny.\n\nThe word 'republic' has long obscured our truth. But now we cast off that hollow shell. We must become the Nation-State of France. We are one people, united in one will. Confusion is over. Compromise is past. Only forward—forward we march.\n\nOur children shall be educated in the name of France, and our soldiers shall die in the name of France.

Engineers are no longer seen as mere auxiliaries, but as the vanguard of national reconstruction. Military and mechanical plants now operate around the clock, as engineers advance military design and industrial automation in unison.\n\nUnder the slogan 'Technology Above All', the government seeks to inaugurate a new era of industrial militarism. Increasingly, it is believed that the fate of a people is not determined by the number of bayonets, but by the precision of the machines that produce them.

The ideological foundations of governance are steadily giving way to a doctrine of precision and pragmatism, encapsulated by a new national slogan: 'Efficiency is the highest form of patriotism.'\n\nThe public response has been quiet but broadly positive. While dissent exists among ideological purists, many now assert that 'a leader should rise from the drafting board, not from the podium.' The French government appears to be moving toward a more tightly organized and systemic administration, one guided not by rhetoric, but by results.

The press, too, has hailed this as a 'reorganization of the state.'\n\nFrom this day forward, France is no longer the loose republic of the past. A new era has begun—one marked by a single direction and a unified order under the clear command of the president."

The new party system is expected to be structured not to incite class conflict, but to promote harmony across the whole of society.\n\nThis declaration by the President is not merely seen as a political reform, but as a philosophical shift forming the foundation of the nation itself.

He proclaimed, 'The Republic has not been dismantled—only renewed,' and announced the full restoration of France's parliamentary system. This is not a mere dispersion of authority, but a conscious attempt to preserve national unity while guaranteeing representative legitimacy.\n\nThe parliamentary functions once dismantled under Pétain are being gradually restored, as France's politics move toward stability through a moderate path that includes cooperation with centrist parties such as the Radicals, under government leadership. De La Rocque declared, 'Extremism divides the nation,' signaling his break with radicalism and his clear distancing from far-right political figures.\n\nThe Parliament will now be reinstated as a responsible complement to the executive branch. All major legislation, mobilization orders will require parliamentary approval. Meanwhile, presidential authority will be preserved—but now understood as a mandate rooted in the trust of both the people and Parliament.\n\nThis political compromise, aimed at stability and unity, is expected to become the foundation of a truly unified France."

Newspapers have described this phenomenon as 'the first true national unity since the Third Republic,' and sociologists are noting the emergence of a new political culture that transcends the limitations of past party politics.\n\nThe government views this development as a historic turning point that will strengthen the foundation of the national community. Ministries have already begun work on establishing dedicated agencies to support the organization and expansion of these popular movements. The people of France are no longer just subjects of governance—they are reclaiming their role as the true drivers of the nation’s future."

The core of his address was captured in a single, powerful declaration: "A Frenchman is not a race. A Frenchman is one who shares in the culture, history, and ideals of France." He emphasized that French citizenship should not be defined by blood or ancestry, but by loyalty to the nation, commitment to the common good, and the defense of universal values. This statement was not mere political rhetoric—it was a deliberate effort to transcend the exclusion, class divisions, and even racist prejudices that had permeated French society.\n\nThe speech was broadcast live across the nation, immediately sparking widespread support from all sectors of society. Among workers, citizens of immigrant descent, and families of colonial veterans, the declaration was received as a message of hope—one that acknowledged their contributions and offered a path to true belonging. The press hailed the moment as 'the return of the French spirit' and 'a redefinition of republican values,' while religious and academic leaders expressed their alignment with the president’s ideological leadership.\n\nFrançois de La Rocque now envisions France not as a mere historical construct, but as a community of citizens united by liberty, duty, and coexistence.

It is ideologically grounded in the spiritual unity of Latin Catholic civilization, including the Vatican, as a foundation for scientific progress.\n\nWithin the cabinet, sentiment is generally favorable. Cooperation with France is seen as a chance to challenge the technological dominance of Germany and Britain while providing real benefits to our industrial sector. However, some Foreign Ministry officials caution against drifting into France’s political orbit, and pragmatic voices warn of diplomatic backlash from Berlin.\n\nAccepting this accord would go beyond scientific collaboration—it would signal our civilizational alignment to the world."

President François de La Rocque described the pact as 'the rightful self-defense of Latin civilization against Germanic expansion,' portraying it as a natural alliance between nations united by faith and tradition.\n\nOpinions within our government are divided. The Ministry of Defense and several diplomats see the agreement as a way to elevate our international stature and prepare for potential future conflict.

Major institutions such as the Paris Academy, the Military Technology Council, and the National Bureau for Industrial Advancement have likewise praised the accord, seeing in it the promise of major advances in aviation, logistics, and communications.\n\nThe press has covered the development with headlines such as "France Emerges as Europe's Academic Capital" and "The Beginning of a Latin Scientific Alliance," while Catholic media, citing unofficial support from the Vatican, have described the agreement as a symbol of civilizational reunification.

We believe the Latin world will awaken in due time." Disappointment is evident within the government, and some advisors believe that economic ties with Germany or a commitment to neutral diplomacy may have influenced the decision.\n\nThe media are reporting the rejection under headlines such as "A Fracture in Latin Unity" and "Between Civilizational Ideals and Political Reality." Meanwhile, voices within the political establishment are calling for a recalibration of France’s foreign policy strategy. The proposed budget and staffing for the joint research institutes are now under full review.\n\nThough this particular collaboration has failed, the resonance of our offer will endure.

Within the government, perspectives vary—some interpret this as a sign of fragmentation within the Latin world, while others focus on the diplomatic nuance that suggests room for future dialogue.\n\nOne thing remains clear: France will not waver.

Never forget 1918.' are reappearing on banners in the streets, while numerous civic groups are organizing spontaneous rallies calling for vengeance.\n\nIn the education sector, a new 'Anti-German National Instruction' curriculum is being introduced, and military academies are adopting tactical doctrines based on hypothetical campaigns against German fronts. The press, too, has amplified its rhetoric, denouncing both the crimes of the German past and the ambitions of its present expansionism.\n\nThis movement has grown beyond simple anti-German feeling. It is now uniting French society under a common, powerful sense of collective purpose. While some claim it is extreme, more and more citizens see it as long-overdue justice.

Law enforcement agencies across the country were immediately granted expanded powers, and dissolution orders were issued against far-left radical groups and far-right militias in cities such as Paris and Marseille. Numerous subversive political publications were also seized.\n\nThe media response has been mixed. Some outlets hail it as 'a turning point for the restoration of order,' while others warn of the encroachment on freedom of expression.

'A republic cannot be sustained by laws and institutions alone,' he proclaimed. 'It must be built upon morality, faith, and the solidarity of the community.' He promised to unify the nation’s guiding principles, which had long remained divided.\n\nThis address marks not merely a rhetorical shift, but a structural redefinition of the republic rooted in ethical governance, Christian values, and active patriotism. The Ministry of Education has already begun distributing a new national ethics curriculum to schools across the country, while media outlets and local governments have launched a nationwide 'Spirit of the Republic' campaign. In public squares, banners reading 'We are One Republic' wave above spontaneous public readings of the president’s words.\n\nPublic reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. After years of disunity and confusion, citizens feel their country is reclaiming a sense of shared moral direction.

This is the first time the future direction of the new Republic has been formally presented to the public. At the core of the proposal is the idea that France's state authority must be unified under the leadership of the President.\n\nAccording to the draft, the President would not merely serve as a head of state but act as a leader who directly represents the people and assumes moral responsibility for the nation. While the legislature would continue to exist, decisive administrative authority would be concentrated in the presidency—reflecting the vision of a 'responsible authority' ensuring the stability of the Republic.\n\nThis structure is seen as a departure from the fragmented party politics that previously led to stagnation, aiming instead to build a strong and coherent Republic. Yet, ironically, due to the overly dominant presidency during the Pétain regime, the new constitution ultimately extends parliamentary power and slightly curtails the President's authority in comparison to the past."

Political parties shall serve as channels for public voice, not instruments of power.'\n\nThis represents a complete break from the class-conflict-driven party politics of the past, establishing a new political ideology centered on the common good.

From its balcony, Maurras declared himself President, promising strong leadership and the restoration of traditional order.

This marks the end of decades of the republican era and the restoration of traditional order. Charles Maurras has been appointed as the King’s chief advisor, pledging to assist in the governance of the nation and to usher in a new era of order and unity.\n\nVersailles has replaced the Élysée Palace as the symbol of national authority, and portraits and emblems of the King now adorn Paris and cities across the provinces.

He condemned these ideologies as forces that undermine the moral foundations of our society, divide the people, and weaken the strength of the nation.\n\nHe particularly pointed to the damage caused by German-style racism, emphasizing that France has historically grown strong through the blending of diverse peoples and cultures. The government has passed the 'Abolition of Racism Act,' repealing all discriminatory laws and policies, and ensuring that every citizen, regardless of origin, holds the right and duty to serve the nation.\n\nThe press has hailed this as 'a new chapter in French society,' noting that it opens the way for more people to contribute in the military, industry, and academia."

 france_wr.137.d:0 "Today, the government of Charles Maurras officially declared a policy of 'Decentralization' during a press conference held at the Élysée Palace. In his speech, he criticized the uniform centralization imposed by the republican government, arguing that it suppressed France’s diversity and potential. Excessive concentration of power in the central government, he claimed, has weakened regional autonomy and traditions, while stifling the creativity of the people.\n\nFrom now on, each region will be granted greater authority and autonomy to develop its economy and society based on its unique culture, history, and resources. The central government will reduce detailed interference and instead focus on its role as a coordinator and supporter. This change will give the regions the opportunity to expand their industries and build more factories, promoting balanced development throughout the nation.\n\nThe press has described this as 'a major transformation in France’s political structure,' while many regional leaders have expressed hope that the reform will usher in a golden age of local development."

However, Jewish citizens who pledge their loyalty to France are not subject to this measure and will instead be welcomed as partners in the nation’s reconstruction. The government announced plans to invest their capital and skills into economic development, restructuring the industrial base of provincial cities, and expanding civilian production capacity.

Under the active support of the government, classical architecture and the study of Latin are flourishing, while the principles of ancient philosophy and science are being incorporated into modern industrial design. This is more than a passing cultural trend—it is becoming the driving force behind a transformation of the nation’s research systems and industrial sectors.\n\nIndustrial research institutes are adopting efficient designs inspired by classical aesthetics and structural principles, while universities have made Latin classical studies a mandatory part of their curricula. The press hails this as a ‘French Renaissance,’ predicting that the wisdom of antiquity and the technology of the modern age will together usher in a new era of prosperity.

Portraits of the King and the royal coat of arms adorned every building, while the streets were decorated with flower petals and flags. The press described the event as ‘the ultimate symbol of the monarchy’s restoration,’ declaring that the day’s spectacle marked the definitive opening of a new era for France.\n\nThis procession was more than a mere ceremony—it was proof that the authority of the King still lived in the hearts of the people.

 france_wr.141.d:0 "Today, Charles Maurras delivered a sweeping speech that shook France’s intellectual circles. He argued that what defines Germany is not merely a set of policies but a dangerous doctrine that threatens the very existence of France. At its core, he claimed, German nationalism is racialist—barbaric to human dignity and destructive to social harmony. He condemned the degeneration of German culture, asserting it has abandoned its classical greatness to rely on force and violence, and he attacked the oppressive centralism that tramples liberty and chokes the vitality of the regions.\n\nHis speech did not remain an academic critique. Maurras openly called for retribution, urging the nation to vow never again to bend to Germany. The hall erupted in cheers and tears as the crowd chanted for punishment.

The King emphasized that the loyalty of the people, their faith, and their firm belief in the future are the most unshakable pillars supporting France. He went on to proclaim that the new French Kingdom is not merely a change of institutions, but the foundation for national unity and spiritual renewal. The crowd erupted in cheers, chanting the King’s name, and many were moved to tears. The press hailed the day as a ‘National Rebirth,’ marking the moment when France, after long years of division and turmoil, was finally united once more. This speech will be remembered in history as the symbolic turning point when the Kingdom of France came to embody not only a political form, but also the living spirit of the nation and its people."

One calls for authority and order, the other for national socialism and coordination, and each hurls insults at the other. Yet amidst this endless quarrel, the people grow weary. Prices rise, wages stagnate, and factories often fall silent. Parliament is filled with shouting and slogans, but provides no solutions.\n\nAmidst this turmoil, smaller voices begin to gather strength. At meetings of railway workers, in assemblies of teachers, in print shops and along the docks, a common belief is heard—that the parties are powerless, and that only labor itself can restore the nation. Revolutionary syndicalism, long confined to the margins, is now slowly becoming the alternative for citizens disillusioned with Doriot and Déat’s feud.\n\nOn the walls of the streets appear posters declaring, ‘The parties quarrel, we work!’ At the gates of factories, graffiti proclaims, ‘The worker is the nation.’ It is still but a modest movement, yet the desire for a new path grows ever clearer amidst the din of political strife."

Their supporters insult one another in newspapers and at rallies, while Parliament resounds with shouting, incapable of action. In the streets, unrest spreads. Strikes multiply, prices soar, and bread lines grow ever longer.\n\nThe people now turn away from the spectacle of party politics with disgust. In cafés and workshops, in schools and at the docks, one hears the same refrain: that it is not politicians but the power of labor that can save France. The old slogans of syndicalism reappear on faded pamphlets and posters, and among younger workers they are no longer seen as relics of the past but as a genuine alternative for the present.\n\nThe greater the impotence of government and parties, the more syndicalism ceases to be a mere murmur on the margins, becoming instead a serious choice for a growing number of citizens."

Taking to a podium erected at the Place de la Concorde, he denounced the impotence and chaos of the parties and promised a new order founded upon workers’ councils. His speech was met with thunderous applause, and the crowd, as if with one voice, began to chant his name.\n\nThis day’s demonstration was not a mere protest, but a decisive moment proving that Monatte and syndicalism had moved from the fringes of politics to the very center of French society."

Some recalled the tragedy of 1871 and believed that the Commune would once again be drowned in blood. Yet the situation is different this time. In Lyon, Brest, Marseille, Le Havre, and other cities, workers have risen up, seizing local government buildings and spreading the flames of syndicalism across the nation.\n\nDisorder is growing even within the army itself, as some soldiers refuse orders, declaring that they will not fire upon the people.

 france_wr.171.d:0 "Since the Democratic Union came to power, France now stands at a decisive crossroads that will determine its future. Having ended the era of oppression and seized control, the Democratic Union must clarify the direction of the new system by electing a Prime Minister. This is not a mere personnel decision but a historic choice that will define France’s political identity and the foundation of state governance in the years ahead.\n\nThe Democratic Union is a coalition of diverse forces, uniting both social democrats and liberals. The former, based on workers, peasants, and the middle class, seek to strengthen social equality and welfare, while the latter emphasize reviving market vitality and reducing state intervention in accordance with liberal principles. Though united under the common goal of rebuilding the French Republic, their visions now stand in direct opposition.\n\nThe halls of Paris are filled with tense silence. Representatives raise their slogans and agendas in heated debate, while citizens gather in the streets, whispering anxiously: ‘Who will lead the new France?’ On one side, workers sing in support of Blum; on the other, industrialists and merchants rally behind Reynaud. The atmosphere is charged with both hope and apprehension.\n\nThe destiny of France is about to be decided. This vote will not only choose a Prime Minister, but also set the political direction of France for years to come."

The social democrat Léon Blum is a symbolic figure who defended democracy even through long years of repression. He speaks for the workers, peasants, and the common people who suffered under war and dictatorship, promising social equality and the creation of a welfare state. His vision is to rebuild France upon the ideals of social democracy, and many citizens hope he will bring forth a 'Just France.'\n\nIn contrast, Paul Reynaud raises the banner of classical liberalism. He argues that to restore economic vitality, the state must reduce excessive interference and allow the market to operate freely. He also emphasizes the stability of parliamentary governance and promises to place France once again at the center of the international stage through pragmatic diplomacy. His supporters believe he will not tie the Republic solely to past ideals, but instead build a 'Strong France' through realistic reforms.\n\nThe assembly hall is filled with both passion and conflict, as representatives listen intently to the final speeches. Will it be Blum’s social justice, or Reynaud’s liberal reform? The Democratic Union must now choose one path, and that choice will decide the fate of all France."

His words left a deep impression on both citizens and representatives, and many now look to him with the expectation that he will guide the Republic into a new era.\n\nFrance has now chosen the path of classical liberalism, and under it, the people will once again reclaim their freedom, rights, and responsibilities."

The decades-long system of state-directed price controls and industrial management has come to an end, and in its place, the principles of market autonomy and the free initiative of individuals will prevail. This policy is not merely an economic shift, but a landmark event that redefines the character of the Republic and reshapes the very foundations of society.\n\nThe Paris Stock Exchange and leading chambers of commerce immediately voiced their approval. Many entrepreneurs and industrialists declared that the 'invisible hand' would once again guide the economy, expressing confidence that France was entering a new age of prosperity. For businesses long stifled by restrictions on free trade and competition, this reform brings fresh energy, while countless members of the middle class and small proprietors believe it will secure their survival and future growth.\n\nYet, opposition has been no less vocal. Labor unions and interventionist intellectuals raised concerns that the state was abandoning its responsibility to maintain balance and social protection. They warned that an unfettered market could deepen inequality and expose the working classes and vulnerable groups to greater insecurity. Pamphlets and newspaper editorials filled the streets with slogans such as 'Freedom or Instability,' plunging French society into heated debate.\n\nThe government, however, defined the reform not as a retreat but as a 'liberation of the nation.' It argued that even without state intervention, the economy would flourish according to its own logic, fueled by the creativity of individuals and enterprises. France, freed from the constraints of the past, now enters the age of a free economy where the market itself will chart the course."

Liberals hailed it as the 'completion of the Republic,' while many citizens looked forward to a life free from political oppression and the burden of state intervention. Yet, opposition arose as well: interventionists and socialists voiced concerns that such freedom might deepen inequality or encourage the shirking of responsibility. Nevertheless, the majority of the nation embraced the principle that the individual must stand before the state, wishing for it to take root as the new spirit of France.\n\nToday, France has once again chosen liberty—and this liberty will become the very strength of the nation."

Business leaders and chambers of commerce likewise welcomed the accord, recognizing that social stability achieved through national consensus could secure lasting prosperity. Citizens gathered in the squares, chanting for a 'Land of Fraternity' and celebrating the dawn of a new era for the Republic.\n\nNot everyone, however, embraced this step. Some radical voices warned that the agreement might blunt the passion of revolution, while conservatives criticized what they saw as excessive state interference. Yet despite these divisions, the accord stood as a collective pledge: that France would once again walk the path of solidarity and cooperation, and that this was the first step toward true social unity beyond division."

Critics warned that parliament might once again invite division and chaos, but the majority rejoiced that power had finally returned to the hands of the people.\n\nOn this day, France was reborn under the name of the Parliamentary Republic, and the heart of democracy began to beat once more."

Workers, peasants, the middle class, and intellectuals alike believed this measure would reduce inequality and restore the true sovereignty of the Republic. While some conservatives and radicals voiced concerns, the majority felt that the ideal of the 'Land of Fraternity' was finally becoming a reality, and they sang out their hopes.\n\nToday, France once again placed service and protection of its citizens at the heart of governance.

Within the halls of the Paris Assembly and party meetings, the sharpest division has emerged between the liberal faction led by Paul Reynaud and the social democratic faction led by Léon Blum. Reynaud and his supporters advocate economic liberalization to restore the vigor of the market and strengthen France in international competition. In contrast, Blum and the social democrats argue that without social equality and welfare-based integration, the Republic has no future.\n\nThough these two currents gathered under the same banner of the Democratic Union, their differences have grown increasingly pronounced. The press has dubbed this the 'two faces of the Democratic Union,' warning that France may once again sink into the mire of division. Citizens in the streets are also debating who the true guardian of the Republic is, while supporters of both sides stage rallies and speeches to demonstrate their strength. The Democratic Union rose to power on the hopes of the people, but if this internal conflict is left unresolved, the legitimacy of the new order will face a grave challenge."

Paul Reynaud and the liberals argued for ‘economic liberalization,’ insisting that only by freeing the market could France survive in international competition. They maintained that granting greater autonomy to enterprises and individuals would restore vitality to industry and open the path to a new prosperity.\n\nYet the social democrats condemned this vision as nothing more than a means of strengthening bourgeois privilege. Blum and his allies countered that without welfare and social protections, the people would once again be driven into poverty and inequality, and that liberal reforms would undermine the very spirit of the Republic. The furious exchanges in the Assembly deepened mutual mistrust, driving the Democratic Union further toward rupture.\n\nOn the streets, citizens themselves split. Merchants and industrialists applauded Reynaud, demanding a freer economy, while workers rallied behind Blum, chanting that ‘prosperity without social justice is a hollow lie.’ France’s future is now at stake, and the Union’s internal divide threatens not just its unity but the very legitimacy of the new order."

His speech won thunderous applause from workers and peasants, and even within the Assembly many hailed his words as the embodiment of justice.\n\nReynaud and the liberals, however, denounced the plan as ‘a road to financial ruin.’ They warned that excessive state spending would drain France’s vitality and drive the nation back into instability. What began as a policy debate quickly escalated into a clash that questioned each faction’s very legitimacy.\n\nOn the streets, the divide spread. Supporters of Blum cried that ‘freedom without equality is empty,’ while Reynaud’s backers argued that ‘sustainable liberty comes only with responsibility.’ The conflict now spills beyond the Assembly, seizing public squares and newspapers alike, and the very survival of the Democratic Union hangs in the balance."

Reynaud and his supporters, who had long championed free markets and individual rights, denounced Blum’s social-democratic policies as driving the nation toward excessive state intervention and fiscal ruin.\n\nThe Assembly quickly descended into chaos, with Democratic Union deputies denouncing the move as treachery. Yet Reynaud and his allies applauded themselves, pledging to follow the 'path of liberty and responsibility.' The citizens, too, were divided. Some praised Reynaud’s courage, while others feared that deepening political division would drag the nation into crisis.\n\nToday’s event was not merely the collapse of a partnership—it was the moment when French politics once more split into two divergent paths."

With that, he led his party and supporters out of the chamber.\n\nWorkers and peasants immediately cheered, and the slogan 'A Republic without equality and welfare is nothing but an empty shell' echoed through the streets. Yet the majority within the Assembly fell into turmoil, forced to admit that the Democratic Union’s mission had been gravely undermined. The press labeled the event 'the collapse of the Democratic Union,' warning that the future of French politics was now in doubt.\n\nFrance once again stood at a crossroads.

Newspapers reported that France has been reborn as a Republic that enriches the daily lives of its citizens, going beyond mere political structures.

Instead, they wandered over the countless faces filling the streets, strolling in the parks, and sitting at café terraces. It was a scene so ordinary, and yet so profoundly great.\n\nIn his mind passed the long winter France had endured: Marshal Pétain’s rigid dictatorship, beginning in 1921, which turned the nation into a barracks where liberty was suffocated in the name of ‘stability.’ Afterward came Doriot’s regime of mass socialism—another prison of a different kind, where individuals were reduced to mere cogs in a collective, stripped of their will by slogans and fanaticism.\n\nIn both eras, the people on these very streets had not been individuals. They were only parts of a machine, meant to keep the state running or to glorify its leader.\n\nBut now, the scene was different. Reynaud saw no ‘masses,’ no ‘people,’ but rather an endless procession of individuals. Each carried their own dream, walking toward their own promises, or enjoying the freedom to stroll without purpose. No permission was needed to shape their destiny—they were free agents of their own fate. The state was no longer their master, but their guardian.\n\nReynaud smiled faintly. What had once been only a revolutionary slogan or a line in the constitution—‘liberty’—now lived and breathed on the streets of Paris. Loud, chaotic, unpredictable, yet dazzlingly alive.

Faces reflected calm confidence and gentle hope for the future. People walked at ease, no longer driven by fear. When a passerby stumbled, several rushed to help him without hesitation. A merchant slipped fruit into a child’s hand, rewarded with a shy, radiant smile. These were not state-imposed duties, but natural acts of kindness born of lives no longer shackled by want.\n\nBlum realized then: true fraternity blossoms only when citizens are free from hunger and oppression. The state ensures dignified lives, and in that space, people rediscover the dignity of others. This was the republic he had long dreamed of.\n\nIn these simple gestures and warm smiles of ordinary citizens, Blum saw that France had become the true land of fraternity—not through grand monuments or proclamations, but through everyday humanity made real."

On the day of the unveiling, crowds filled the streets, while families of the fallen and veterans embraced one another in tears. The head of state declared from the podium: 'Without their sacrifice, there would be no France today.' Fresh flowers will forever rest at its base, and future generations will learn the meaning of freedom and nationhood before it. The monument is not only a place of remembrance, but a symbol of unity for the future. Today, Paris is once again called the 'City of Heroes.'"

Bells will ring, flags will be lowered in remembrance, and ceremonies will fill the squares; schools, workshops, and homes alike will share the same story.

The colonies are being reorganized under the authority of France, and even newly independent nations are seeking their path within the new order shaped around us.

Rather than questioning France’s goodwill, they argued that any systemic integration could undermine their long-standing tradition of neutrality. In particular, tying Switzerland’s financial and industrial structures too closely to France was judged to be a long-term threat to Swiss independence and autonomy.\n\nIn France, this decision has sparked both regret and frustration. Some critics denounce Switzerland as overly isolationist, claiming that they have abandoned efforts toward collective stability in Europe. Others, however, acknowledge that strict adherence to neutrality is consistent with Swiss identity. Regardless, this refusal clearly limits France’s diplomatic strategy, and building trust beyond the Alps now seems destined to be a far more distant goal."

French diplomats argue that transferring the territory would simplify bilateral relations and strengthen both the Alpine defensive line and the security of the frontier.\n\nHowever, this demand poses a serious challenge to Switzerland’s neutrality and territorial integrity. Romandy has long been an integral part of the Swiss Confederation, and its inhabitants firmly identify as Swiss citizens. Accepting France’s demand could avert the danger of war, but it would also mean a grave concession that undermines Swiss sovereignty. The Swiss government must now decide between national pride and security."

With this decision, Switzerland has made clear its determination to preserve independence and territorial integrity.\n\nIn France, the rejection has provoked both anger and disappointment.

The railways and roads were filled with French trucks heading toward the ruined factories, each loaded with dismantling plans and work orders.\n\nWe carried within us the long-buried fury forged under German steel — the humiliation of 1871, the fall of Paris, the families lost in smoke and rubble. Now, we were exacting that revenge quietly but thoroughly. When the officer gave the signal, soldiers and engineers entered the factories. The massive shafts of the presses were taken apart, turbines were unbolted, and cranes groaned as they lifted what had once powered an empire. Amid the smell of oil and burning metal, no one spoke. The soldiers’ faces bore only cold duty.\n\nThe conscripted German workers lowered their heads as they dismantled their own machines. They did not need to be told — they knew this was not merely the destruction of steel, but the tearing out of their nation’s heart. One French soldier paused, staring at a heated piece of metal, and murmured, "This is Metz avenged." His words echoed through the hollowed hall.\n\nThe dismantled machines were loaded onto trains bound for France. None of us knew where they would go — some would be reused, reborn into new factories; others melted down and forgotten. But what mattered was this: none of it would ever return to German hands. Their industry, their pride, their power had now bowed beneath France’s victory.\n\nAs night fell and the final locomotive pulled away, we stopped to look back.

Jean Filiole, the former head of the secretive organization 'La Cagoule'—who had once operated in the shadows carrying out assassinations—was assigned the task of 'Francization' for the Renanie district. He was charged with erasing every trace of German presence and inscribing French symbols in their place. When he stood before the tricolour and swore his oath, his gaze already bore the fanatic intensity of a man beyond ordinary limits.\n\nNext was Jacques Barno. A technocratic bureaucrat by background, he was entrusted with control over the Danube district’s resources. Vichard did not ask him for military glory; he demanded efficiency, extreme productivity, and the ruthless conversion of human beings into variables within a system. Barno received the order and answered with a cold smile. For him, this appointment represented not politics but the fulfilment of an administrative calculus.\n\nFinally, General Maxim Beygand was summoned. He was named military supervisor of the Albis district — the frontier facing the eastern red power and the bulwark of European civilisation. Yet Vichard’s instruction was not merely defensive: Beygand was to root out German identity entirely in that land and to implant French order by any necessary means. Beygand bowed his head and accepted; his eyes reflected a soldier’s loyalty and a bloody resolve.\n\nThat day, three writs were issued from Paris.

The massive form of the German Empire had vanished, and in its place stood a new nation called the ‘German Federation.’ His goal was clear — to liberate them from Prussian militarism and lead them toward the ideal of human liberty. There was no longer any reason for hostility.\n\nYet the newspapers were filled with reports of Germany’s devastation. Society was in turmoil, and the streets were overflowing with the starving. In the hearts of the French people, the thrill of vengeance was slowly giving way to compassion. It was a time for humanitarian aid.\n\nBut to Reynaud, a classical liberal, it was not right for the French government to feed them through heavy taxation. Such an approach would only lead to bloated bureaucracy and inefficiency. He envisioned a freer, more market-oriented method. The government would take only a minimal role, leaving the rest to individual goodwill and the autonomy of the market. His action was limited to words of encouragement and example.\n\nSoon, his vision became reality. Across France, voluntary donation campaigns began. Churches and civic organizations founded relief foundations, while countless citizens donated clothing and food. Major corporations also contributed large sums through charitable foundations bearing their names, gaining both goodwill and favorable prospects in the German market. This was not the result of coercive taxation, but of voluntary choice and self-interest.\n\nReynaud looked at a newspaper photograph showing French volunteers handing bread to German children. Without government orders, free individuals and enterprises had gathered to create order and efficiency. This was, indeed, the true way of liberty."

There was no longer any reason for hostility.\n\nBut the joy of victory was brief. Newspapers were filled daily with grim reports from Germany — hunger, despair, and chaos among those who had lost everything to war. In the hearts of the French people, the thrill of revenge gradually gave way to compassion. Something had to be done.\n\nYet postwar France was far from wealthy. The state could not take responsibility for everything. Blum pondered deeply. What France must show to Germany was not overwhelming wealth or power, but the very ideal of the Republic — fraternity itself.\n\nUnder his direction, the French government established the ‘Humanitarian Relief Foundation for the German People.’ The government provided initial funding and used the press to shed light on the suffering of the defeated, stirring the empathy of the French public. It was not an order, but an appeal.\n\nThe results were remarkable. The spark of goodwill ignited by the government spread across the country like wildfire. Citizens, even in modest circumstances, gave what they could — an old coat, a can of food, a child’s toy. From every walk of life, the French people extended their hands in voluntary compassion.\n\nBlum looked at a newspaper photograph showing a long line of citizens in front of boxes filled with donated goods. The state had shown the way, and the people had answered its call. Solidarity without coercion, empathy without obligation — this was the true path of France. Blum smiled. This was, indeed, the way of fraternity."

Newspapers reported daily on the extreme hardship and poverty gripping postwar Germany. The streets were crowded with unemployed workers and starving children. Monatte muttered bitterly under his breath.\n\n"What crime have the workers committed?"\n\nIt was not the workers who caused the war, but the Kaiser and the capitalist class. He did not order grand state-led relief; such things were, to him, the hypocritical charity of bourgeois nations. Instead, he appealed to the syndicates and communes of France.\n\nThe guilty, he declared, were the Junkers and the capitalist elite who led the old empire, while the German working people were brothers to be liberated. To those brothers, the workers of France must extend their revolutionary hand of solidarity.\n\nFrance answered without hesitation. Across the nation, local communities and unions organized their own humanitarian efforts. The textile syndicate of Lyon gathered clothing they had produced, the dockworkers of Marseille loaded ships with food purchased from union funds, and the printers of Paris sent pamphlets of revolution alongside loaves of bread.\n\nIt was not a vast, state-directed campaign. But in every relief box lay the genuine touch of workers’ hands and the message of comradeship that transcended borders. This aid and conviction would strike deeper than any bullet — into the minds of the starving German people.\n\nMonatte smiled quietly. This was, indeed, the true way of revolution."

In the small backyard of a Parisian townhouse, an old man quietly watched each blossom. Once hailed as the 'Lion of Verdun' and a man who once wielded all power in France as its President, Philippe Pétain now sat frail and aged on his balcony, gazing silently upon his garden.\n\nSince his resignation in the upheaval of 1934, Pétain had been completely driven out of politics. Watching his roses had become one of the few hobbies left to him.\n\n'...Today, France marched triumphantly through the Reichstag and the streets of Berlin. Among those leading this glorious parade were Commander-in-Chief Maurice Gamelin and...'\n\nFrom the radio on the table came the constant broadcasts of the Allied victory parade in Berlin. The press, now reduced to Doriot’s mouthpieces, endlessly proclaimed that this great French victory had been achieved under his leadership.\n\nPétain remembered Doriot as the brash young communist agitator who once brawled in the streets of Saint-Denis—a man devoid of French dignity, honor, or reverence for God. To Pétain, such a figure could never be seen as worthy of leading France.\n\nYet, regardless of his feelings, Doriot—the beast, as Pétain thought of him—had seized power and accomplished the long-awaited destruction of Germany. The nation rejoiced, intoxicated by the sweetness of victory.\n\nBut Pétain could not share their joy. Even in triumph, his heart was heavy with sorrow for a France whose moral fabric was being eroded under Doriot’s rule. The sacred values of family, labor, and fatherland were being desecrated by a demagogue with neither grace nor faith. Such a France was too painful for him to behold.\n\nHaving severed all ties with politics, the old marshal could do little but sigh at what his country had become. Rising slowly from his chair, Pétain turned off the radio, leaving behind a bitter silence as he stepped back into his home.\n\nWhat, he wondered, would become of France’s destiny?"

If Doriot carried the reek of sewers, Déat smelled of dust-laden books and rotten ink. He crushed France's ideals in the name of 'efficiency,' turning the nation into a vast factory and the French into its components. This was Pétain's verdict on Déat.\n\nIt was true that France had been remade into a colossal war machine and that Germany was overthrown — but to Pétain this was no honorable victory. To defeat the German monster, France had been made into a monster of its own. The thought set him trembling, and a deep sigh rose from within.\n\n\"To slay a monster, we have become the monster ourselves!\"\n\nWhere, he wondered, does the great France remain?"

Yet his face bore neither despair nor defeat.\n\nThough all his political foundations had crumbled, his legacy had once again come to dominate France. And at last, the dream of punishing Germany — the dream shared by every Frenchman — had been fulfilled.\n\nHe lifted the newspaper and looked upon a photograph of Charles de Gaulle delivering a speech. He could still picture that tall, stubborn young officer who had once served under his command, debating tactics and doctrine with unyielding conviction.\n\nHe had done it. The work the old man had begun — the younger man had completed.\n\nSome said Pétain had been wrong, and de Gaulle was right. But to Pétain, that was a contradiction. The powerful Republic de Gaulle had built — whence came its authority? From the belief that France needed a decisive leader, not a debating assembly; that the chaos of parties and parliaments must end. These were the old marshal’s lifelong convictions — and now, they lived on in de Gaulle’s France.\n\nWhile the old man had been the 'shield' that preserved the nation from collapse, de Gaulle had become the 'sword' that carried it forward. Pétain had protected France; de Gaulle rebuilt it upon that foundation. The world might call their paths divergent, yet in truth, both had prayed at the same altar — for France.\n\nHis every act, his every word — all had been vindicated.

No — this was the work of the French Army he had disciplined and restored during the interwar years, an institution of honor and strength. If anything, he thought, the current government had only stood in the army’s way.

Among civilized men, how deranged must one be to forget the upheaval of 1848? Even he found it absurd that such reactionaries—those blind to the future—had taken hold of France’s reins. What a ridiculous notion it was.\n\nYet even as he laughed, tears welled in his eyes.

How could a fragmented France, divided under the banner of decentralization, led by men who spoke in convoluted rhetoric of meaningless ideals, have achieved such a feat?\n\nDressed once more in his marshal’s uniform, the old man saw his reflection in the mirror as drool slipped from his lips. Ah—what a foolish mistake. He had forgotten how absurd his own image could look when he tried to dwell on reality. Clicking his tongue, he wiped his mouth with a handkerchief.\n\nHe stepped outside and collapsed gently into the chair on his balcony, watching the sunset.

France was reborn, and she soared like an eagle taking flight.\n\nHigh in the heavens, the eagle struck down upon the serpent. Germany—the viper—was torn in two in an instant. The Russian bear, too, was no match for him; its eyes were pierced, its flesh ripped apart, and it soon collapsed, never to rise again.\n\nFrance had triumphed—over weakness, over her eternal enemies, and over the mightiest of foes.\n\nMaurras sat beside the King, watching as His Majesty delivered the victory address from the podium. And as the King stood tall above the crowd, so too did France stand proudly at the center of Europe. It was a glory that would never fade from the world."

The true workers of France rose once more, seizing their destiny with their own hands.\n\nPierre Monatte was neither a politician nor a general, but he believed in the workers more than anyone, and he was certain that France’s future lay in their hands. When the slogans of the streets turned into the sirens of the factories, and the roar of weapons became the song of labor, a new dawn rose over France.\n\nDoriot’s tyranny has fallen. Germany has been defeated once again. And the false communist state of the Soviet Union, which exploited its people from the crimson palace of Moscow, has crumbled before the righteous fury of the French worker. Now, the French Revolution has crossed borders, spreading the flame of true liberation across Europe.\n\nFrance is governed not by the state, but by syndicates; not by capital, but by labor; not by power, but by solidarity. Each industry is managed by autonomous unions, and production and distribution are guided through collective agreement.\n\nEurope has been liberated. The kings and dictators of the old world are gone. In their place stand countless workers—people who govern their own lives. The revolution is complete. France now belongs to the people."

Machinists! Electricians! Anyone with factory supervision experience, step forward!\"\n\nA faint stir rippled through the ranks of prisoners. Most were too starved and broken to move, but in a few eyes flickered a faint light—something between suspicion and hope. Luc examined each face carefully. He was not looking for the calloused hands of soldiers, but for the stained, oil-marked fingers of craftsmen, and the sharp gaze of men who could read blueprints.\n\nA middle-aged sergeant stepped forward. Before the war, he had worked in a Munich factory as a master machinist. Luc studied his hands—short and rough, yet marked by the precision of a lifetime with machines.\n\n\"That one. Take him.\"\n\nLuc gave the order curtly. His fellow officers strapped white armbands onto the chosen men and separated them from the crowd.\n\nThey were no longer prisoners of war. They were 'assets' for national reconstruction, 'cogs' in the great European community.\n\nOf course, they were still tainted by their old ideologies. But that was no concern. A few months in a reeducation facility would cleanse their minds completely. Gone would be their obsolete nationalism and corrupted loyalties—only the sacred values of labor and production would remain. They were being offered, instead of hopeless captivity, a chance to become part of a new society.\n\nIt was both mercy and efficiency.\n\nAs dozens of engineers gathered together, Luc looked at them with satisfaction.

His vision whitened, the smell of powder numbed his nose, and he could barely see what he was firing at.\n\nWhen his finger came off the trigger and the mechanical click fell silent, he finally came to his senses.\n\nThe German soldiers lay prone.

The fires, fierce remnants of battle, still licked hungrily at the collapsed remains of buildings.\n\nBeside him, the two faces of war passed indifferently. On one side, hundreds of German prisoners marched in endless columns, heads bowed, being led to the rear. The hollow eyes of those who had once claimed to be the masters of Europe. On the other, French armored cars and trucks kicked up dust as soot-streaked soldiers took up positions, the new masters of a foreign city.\n\nThe defeated and the victors. That was the only order the world recognized.\n\nMarceau walked toward the city’s central square. There stood what had once been its heart and pride — a great cathedral. Or rather, what was left of it. The roof had collapsed entirely, and where there had once been stained-glass windows, there now yawned gaping holes that screamed black smoke into the sky. The centuries-old spire had become a colossal torch, setting the night ablaze.\n\nHe stood there in silence for a long time, watching. Everything that cathedral had once symbolized — the German god, the German history, the German culture — was melting away in the flames. He felt no guilt, no sorrow. Only emptiness — and within that emptiness, a cold, satisfying calm. This was the revenge they had sought.\n\nHe murmured softly toward the burning cathedral, his voice barely audible.\n\n\"Yes… burn forever.\"\n\nNot only this city, but every trace of their arrogant memory and history — until nothing remained but ash.

They were all covered in the same mud, flinching under the same artillery shrieks.\n\nKarim remembered the road that brought him here. When President de la Rocque declared that 'French identity is decided by spirit, not skin,' many in Algiers had been skeptical. The law could forbid discrimination, but it could not erase what people carried in their hearts. And yes—there were still looks in the army that saw them as colonial subjects. But those looks could no longer be spoken aloud.\n\nYet here, in the heart of the bombardment, none of that mattered. The bullets did not distinguish between a Parisian, an Algerian, or a Breton.

The metal latch creaked open, and with it came the fragrance of civilization itself. Today’s feast, different from yesterday’s sardines, was revealed: a neatly sealed tin of pork pâté, a slab of butter-laden hard biscuit, a small piece of saucisson, and a bar of chocolate as black as night. The highlight, of course, was a small, squat bottle of red wine — a luxury one would hardly believe issued on the front lines.\n\nJulien carefully spread a thick layer of pâté over the biscuit and took a bite. The rich, fatty flavor wrapped gently around his battle-weary tongue. He closed his eyes to savor it. This place might have been a nameless German wasteland, but for that brief moment, his taste buds were seated in a Parisian bistro. He washed it down with a sip of wine — surely a blessing from God Himself.\n\nHe found himself wondering about the enemy beyond the front line. What were they eating now? Probably some sawdust sausage made of questionable meat, washed down with that disgusting Ersatz coffee. Poor bastards, he thought — men who would never know the true joy of living.

Far off, the German AT gun leapt skyward in a cloud of black smoke.\n\nHellish training days came back: instructors riding them harder than the real front ever would. After thousands of repetitions their bodies moved before thought. Here, under falling shells, felt almost familiar. Some wore easy smiles; some even felt the hunter’s thrill. On the radio came a report that the air force had wiped out a forward target. Alain throttled up, smashing through trees like paper as they punched through the woods. Dozens of friendly tanks followed. They were the blade of the operation, tearing up the enemy rear. All of it came from their trust—in one another, in the training that had scarred them, and in"

 france_wr.284.d:0 "The artillery was ready. Hundreds of muzzles pointed silently at the German city ahead. In the forward command tent, the commander listened to the sweep of the second hand on a field watch laid on the map. Everything waited on his final word. The scouts’ report already lay on the table:\n\n'Enemy line collapsing. Extreme disorder.'\n\nHe didn’t need the paper to see the misery beyond. In his binoculars: a long column of civilian refugees trying to flee the city, tangled with frightened German soldiers retreating in disarray. No true defensive line, only chaos. If he ordered the barrage now, the city would fall before noon. Militarily, the 'easiest' victory. He didn’t want it. Pouring shells into that defenseless throng was not a battle; it was a massacre. Not the work of a republic. He lowered the glasses. Instead of grabbing the radio, he turned to the artillery officer on standby.\n\n"Delay the offensive two hours. My authority."\n\nThe officer looked puzzled, but he was firm.\n\n"Give them time. Time for the civilians to get out."\n\nThe order went out, and the batteries returned to silence and waiting. In the command tent, amid taut nerves, only the sound of the clock cut the hush, crisp and clear as it flowed on"

 france_wr.285.d:0 "A sky without a cloud can be the stage for the fiercest duels. French fighter pilot Julien spotted a glint far off—a German fighter. As if by pact, the two hurtled toward each other and the chase began. They were evenly matched. Climbs, dives, savage turns for minutes on end. When Julien seemed to have the edge, the German slipped free with a clever move and took his tail again. A hard fight.\n\nThen the German overreached in a single turn. Julien didn’t miss the instant. He slid onto the enemy’s six and let the cannon speak. Black smoke billowed, and the German spun out of control. Moments later a tiny speck popped free—a white parachute blossomed like a flower.\n\nJulien confirmed the kill and eased toward it, throttling back until he was level beside the slowly descending German. The man hung under silk, staring at him, terrified—braced for the final burst. Julien didn’t line up the sight. Instead he snapped a neat salute inside the canopy and raised his thumb.\n\n"Good fight."\n\nHe pushed the stick forward again. The engine note climbed as"

After decentralization, the French army had united under the King’s name, yet each unit still kept a strong regional flavor. Naturally, men clustered with those from home.\n\n"This damned muck’s worse than the Breton tidal flats."\n\nA fisherman from Brittany grumbled. A man from Provence shot back,\n\n"Quit whining. Compared to our summer cloudbursts, this is nothing."\n\nParisians looked on with feigned disdain and chatted among themselves about the latest city fashions, trading jokes in their own accents. Instead of the fear of imminent death, the trench hummed with the bustle of a marketplace and a subtle rivalry spanning all of France. Then, from the rear, hundreds of guns tore the sky at once. Shells arced overhead toward the enemy, explosions thudding the earth in endless waves. A whistle cut the air.\n\nThe signal to attack. Instantly the chatter died. Every man who had been bickering moments before gripped his weapon and climbed the parapet. There were no Bretons or Provençals, no Parisian dandies or country lads—only French soldiers. Charging the enemy, they roared with one vast voice."

Captain Henri of the French Air Force was punching through the German air defenses to sweep enemy fighters from the sky for the 'storm' of friendly armor.\n\n"Bandit down!" came a comrade’s voice over the radio. Henri checked fuel and ammo, chasing the mirror-bright tail of a German fighter. With a waspish burst of guns, the enemy trailed black smoke and spiraled down. One more gone. He dipped his nose to breathe—and the sight below took him.\n\nHundreds of French tanks surged like a steel tide toward the German lines. They crushed the woods, shattered trenches, drove without fear. It was like a charge of medieval knights—only wrought in iron. Main guns thundered, machine guns spat fire, and through the chaos they kept perfect formation. For a moment Henri felt less like a pilot and more like a guardian in the sky, escorting that chivalric host. This was the 'true glory of France' the King had spoken of—an age where the kingdom’s past met modern craft: knights of steel racing across the earth, and knights of the air shielding them above.\n\nHe gripped the stick again. Plenty of fuel remained. So long as their charge did not stop, neither could his flight."

In their minds hundreds of guns were already shredding the enemy line with every type of shell. There was no room for wishful optimism or defeatist gloom—only calculation and data. They ran the vanguard’s penetration and follow-on disruption of the enemy rear again and again.\n\n"After the break, the strike group wheels left; infantry hold center."\n\nThe complex, heated sand-table exercise drove swiftly to a conclusion under practiced hands.

Their chief concern was the movement of the mobile force and the armored divisions.\n\n"If the armor breaks through here, the mobile force swings left to cut the enemy retreat. Fuel and ammo resupply follows Plan B."\n\nThey ran this breach, including likely enemy reactions, over and over in their heads and on the map.

 france_wr.290.d:0 "The sky died first. Black smoke smothered the sun, then came the cursed whistling as a rain of fire fell. Countless French incendiaries and white-phosphorus rounds blotted the heavens. Great balls of flame burst over the German trench line. It wasn’t mere explosion—the sticky fires of hell clung to earth, timber, and human skin and would not go out. The horizon glowed like a vast furnace. The posts holding the wire burned like matchsticks. Everything green turned to soot and scattered on the wind. The air grew too hot to breathe; the screams dwindled quickly.\n\nPierre, a member of the vanguard, checked the collar of his flame-retardant gear one last time amid the heat that felt like the breath of hell. He hefted his heavy flamethrower and checked the valve on the fuel tank. There was no fear—only the numb resolve to end this hell and move to the next objective.\n\n"Vanguard, forward!"\n\nAt the shout, they sprinted into no-man’s-land while the fires still flickered. The ground baked underfoot; the air stank of acrid smoke and burning flesh. Not a single expected machine-gun burst met them. No resistance. When they dropped into the trench, what filled it wasn’t enemy fire, but stench.\n\nThe trench had become a colossal crematorium. Charred bodies lay twisted everywhere. Some clutched rifles turned to coal; others were fused with melted bunker doors. Now and then something still alive twitched in the ash—no longer human shaped, only burned meat. When a faint groan rose, a comrade stepped over and finished it with a pistol—coldly ending the pain. No one called it mercy. No one felt guilt. It was merely cleanup for the next job.\n\nPierre walked to the dark mouth of a collapsed bunker, nozzle in hand—for any survivor, or any last resistance. He squeezed the trigger and a long tongue of flame devoured the black. The trench sweep wasn’t a fight; it was a one-sided burning. Moments later the radioman reported into the set, his dry, clerical tone jarringly out of place amid the scene."

 france_wr.291.d:0 "The earth shook—not with thunder, but with the simultaneous roar of hundreds of tank engines and the drumbeat of constant shelling. The battlefield was a maelstrom of steel and flame. Overhead, French strike aircraft darkened the sky, screaming low and raking the ground with guns and bombs that stretched the line of fire to the horizon. On the ground flowed a river of steel with no visible end. Hundreds—perhaps thousands—of French tanks carpeted the earth as they advanced. The enemy was already broken. Their defenses shredded like paper before the overwhelming mass. Survivors crawled from churned trenches only to drop rifles and helmets and flee in terror. They were no longer soldiers—only prey ruled by instinct. This was not battle but pursuit and slaughter.\n\nInside the cramped, sweltering hull, gunner Michel never lifted his eye from the sweat-slick sight. In that steel tube reeking of powder and oil, only his hands stayed calm, turning the wheels. In magnified view he caught a knot of German infantry scattering like ants. The intercom snapped with the commander’s cold, mechanical coordinates.\n\n"Eight hundred ahead. Withdrawing infantry mass. HE. Aim."\n\nMichel’s crosshair settled on the densest cluster.\n\n"On."\n\n"Fire."\n\n"Shot!"\n\nThe main gun cracked like the world splitting; the hull lurched back. Through the sight he rode his shell’s arc. It burst among the fleeing men—a terrible, almost beautiful flash. Those at the center simply ceased to be; around them, dirt, fragments, and a red mist flew.\n\n"Next round!"\n\nThe loader had already kicked the hot casing clear and rammed a new shell home. Michel hunted for the next target. Left and right, as far as he could see, friendly tanks never stopped firing. They had become a vast steel roller, grinding down every speck of resistance—and everything else—before them. Those who ran were torn apart by shells; those who stumbled were caught beneath the tracks. Michel had become numb to the faint thumps when the tank rolled over something, to the ugly crunch below as bones and gear gave way. The heavy tracks mashed the recently living into the dirt, forming a rough grave as they"

In the trench, the comrades of the vanguard watched in silence, rifles and SMGs tight in their hands. As the barrage ebbed and finally stopped, a hellish stillness fell.\n\nThen, from the foremost slot, a soldier with a red armband vaulted up first. He looked back and cried out,\n\n"Comrades, charge! For liberation!"\n\nAt his cry, every man in the trench surged up as one, shouting, and stormed into the enemy lines still veiled in smoke."

Gunner Marc coaxed a small fire from a scrap ammo crate while driver Jules opened rations.\n\n"She held up beautifully today," Jules said, stabbing into the bean tin with a knife. The puncture rang loud in the night air.\n\n"Paris comrades built her. My brother did some welding there," Marc added, warming his hands.
