 WELTPOLITIK_NAME:0 "The Age of Weltpolitik"
 WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Two decades ago, the German Empire emerged victorious from the Weltkrieg, shattering the Entente and proving Weltpolitik right—the Kaiser’s hegemony was absolute. Yet beneath the triumph, resentment festered. The vanquished nursed their wounds, radicalism spread, and Germany ruled with an iron fist. Then came the crash of 1929. The Great Depression ignited unrest, toppled governments, and shook the Weltreich. Cracks widen, certainties fade—the peace of the Weltkrieg was no peace at all, only a prelude to the next storm."

 USA_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "As the US had stayed neutral in hopes to become not only a strong and mighty power, able to overtake the west on it's own, it had made massive success, as in the "roaring twenties", a time of economic prosperity and great living standards, a new age of stability had arisen. But ever since the catastrophe of 1929, the great depression, the americans have started to crumble and fail. Desperately, newly elected President Roosevelt had started the New Deal, and since then america was on the rise, and while the giant sleeps, it may soon awaken..."

 ENG_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "After the french had ultimately surrendered in 1919, the british were unable to keep up with the war effort, and were forced to sign the "most painful treaty in history", which was an over exaggerating pushed by the Mosleyites, but a common view in the british populus. The british empire lost most it's african colonies in the treaty, the parliament was dissolved thrice since 1920 when the armistice was signed. And even now, the government is deeply unpopular in the public, and it will most likely fall to extremists and revolutionaries, will they be able to become the empire on which the "sun never sets", once again?"

 FRA_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "France was hit the hardest by the great war, not only was it devastated after the war, it had lost very important and industrialized territories, and having to pay massive amounts of money to the germans, they had become the perfect ground for extremists to settle in, and after the "March on Paris", Georges Valois was instated as the supreme ruler, and while he was able to avoid germany noticing his military buildup, it may not be enough to beat the germans, and the only way to tell if a repeat of 1871 and 1919 will happen, or if Valois will lead france from her ruins, is for time to tell."
 
 GER_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Germany was able to prove it's greatness after defeating the Entente, it had become the hegemon of europe, africa and the seas of the world. But as germany had manifested it's rule over europe, the great depression of 1929 would hit, and devastate not only the economy but also the people, and while the Kaiser holds onto his constitutional power, political intability would reign over the so mighty german empire. And while it may hold onto its position, if the empire can survive the challenge soon to be laid onto it by the former Entente, reconstituted in the "National Entente", only time, blood and iron will tell."

 SOV_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "As the Entente had fully given up, it had given the bolsheviks enough time to launch multiple succesful offensives against the white russians, and the germans were unable to interfere as the occupation of the new eastern territories would prove to be a great challenge, thus, the reds would ultimately win and secure their position, but as Lenin died in 1924, the three cliques - The Marxist-Leninists, the NEP fanatics and the Bolshevik-Leninists and their permanent revolution had brought the soviet state into chaos, but will Stalin hold onto power? Or will the oppositions seize the state, like they did in 1917?"

 AUH_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "The russians had tried to break up the multi-ethnic state that is Austria-Hungary, but as they had fallen into civil war, and the austro-hungarians would secure their empire by winning the great war, they were able to bring back some stability. But is it enough to hold the empire together? Many austrian supremacists call for a reconstiution of Austria-Hungary back into the Austrian Empire, the empire of the east, but many are for an extension of the crowns and a third, illyrian crown, it all lays in the hands of the Kaiser, he will decide the fate of the already unstable empire."

 TUR_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Similar to Austria-Hungary, the ottomans have various ethnicities and nations within their state, and reform needs to happen to ensure a continued peaceful cooperation between the ethnic groups, but two camps had formed, the Western Kemalists and the ottomanists, who are turkic supremacist, fundamentalists who want to smash arab autonomy, but as the Ottoman Empire is still economically weak and backwards, miltiarily a minor power and politically a powderkeg, either of them could lead to collapse or eternal glory, only time will really tell who will suceed."

 ITA_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Italy was one of the losers of World War I. They had to give Austria the northeastern lands. Vittorio Emmanuel III came down from the throne bearing the responsibility for the defeat, and Umberto II, who succeeded him, was also deposed shortly thereafter with the country's transformation into a republic. Since then, Italy has been in a state of extreme political turmoil, and the Great Depression of 1929 completely destroyed Italy's politics and economy. The national chaos became the growth engine of far-right fascist forces, which led to the party's landslide victory in the 1933 general election in Italy."

 SPR_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Spain is one of the few countries that escaped from the aftermath of the Great War. Born in 1935, the Second Republic of Spain has enormous internal turmoil caused by ideological conflicts. The election in February 1937 will determine Spain's future. In the run-up to this general election, internal conflict is deepening again, and maybe violence is the only way to end these conflicts."

 GRE_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "After World War I, Greece faced a series of very chaotic situations. Defeat in the Great War forced Greece to pay huge amounts of compensation, plus political and economic turmoil. Nevertheless, many people have a dream of recovering Goto, called "Megali Idea," and have a glimmer of hope."

 BUL_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "After three Balkan wars, Bulgaria became the sole hegemonic power of the Balkans. Serbia, competing with Bulgaria, became a vassal state of Austria-Hungary, and Greece fell with great defeat. But decades after World War I. Greece and Romania began to threaten Bulgaria. If there is no preparation for this, maybe Bulgaria will lose its war against them."

 JAP_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "The japanese were the only country in east asia to succesfully modernize, while still keeping the warrior tradition, the navy became the pride of the empire, but even winning in the first sino-japanese war and the russo-japanese war was not enough, as the entry into the great war would prove that japan was not yet ready, as they had lost the war, they had not lost any meaningful territory, but the spirit for revenge still helped in further radicalization, and the Showa financial crisis had paved the way for the full military take over, the emperor was allowed to stay, but he no longer had any real power. Will the military be able to fulfill japan's imperial goals?"

 FNG_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "The Fengtian Clique is the only Beiyang Clique that has survived from the Kuomintang Northern Expedition by the Nationalist Party in the past. It succeeded in preventing the Kuomintang Army with the help of Japan and Germany, especially Germany, but as Japan's influence inside the Fengtian grew, Germany began to help Kuomintang, not the Fengtian. Amid the ongoing dispute between the two warlords – the Fengtian government and the Kuomintang Government – over the mainland China – the question of who will succeed in unifying China is at argument for many political and diplomatic scholars."

 CHI_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Sun Yat-sen realized his dream of becoming a republic on the continent in 1911. However, the dream of a democratic republic ended with the reality of Yuan Shai and the warlords era. Nonetheless, Challenge of Sun Yat-sen to establish a true republic came to a climax in the, Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition. However, foreign powers interfered, and China was divided into two governments. The failure of the northern expedition also significantly weakened Chiang Kai-shek's position. However, the Kuomintang's will to invade the North is still firmly established, and they want to unify China by any means."

 SAF_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Britain was defeated in the Great War. By the treaty between Britain and Central Powers, South Africa separated from the Commonwealth and became a republic. However, this deeply racist country is fostering a serious division between British-South Africans, Boers, blacks and Collard. It is making our country very dangerous."

 CAN_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Despite its participation in the World War, Canada was not significantly affected by the long distance from its main battlefields. However, the Great Depression and the collapse of Britain's economy, as a suzerain state, caused significant disruption in Canadian society and led to the expansion of groups with radical ideas. Section 98 of the Criminal Code prevented extremist forces from participating in politics, but the Canadian society is still uneasy."

 UKR_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Once the breadbasket of the Reich, Ukraine exists only as long as Berlin wills it. Placed on the throne by German bayonets in 1920 to replace the defiant Pavlo Skoropadskyi, Vasyl von Habsburg rules a land that loathes him. The Holodomor of 1932 shattered any illusions of stability, as millions starved while Germany took their grain, and the once-loyal Sich Riflemen turned to bitterness. Now, German settlers tighten their grip, anti-Habsburg sentiment festers, and the Grand Duchy stands like a house of cards. Any misstep by Vasyl could send it all crashing down"
