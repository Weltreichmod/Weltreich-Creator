 WELTPOLITIK_NAME:0 "The Age of Weltpolitik"
 WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Just some 2 decades ago, the German Empire had won the "Weltkrieg", the great war. German hegemony was established over europe, and painful treaties were enforced on the Entente, which led to a rise of ultranationalism and extremism, while the "Weltreich" had held out and maintained it's iron fist over europe. But all that changed in the Great Depression of 1931, which saw europe crumble, and extremists rising once again. While german hegemony was not yet shattered, the shadow of death and war is lurking over the new order..."

 USA_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "The United States, having maintained neutrality with the hope of not only surpassing the West through its own strength but also becoming a powerful and influential great nation, entered a new era of stability and prosperity known as the 'Stable Twenties.' However, following the disaster of the Great Depression in 1929 and the subsequent economic collapse spreading from Europe in 1931, America began to falter and decline. The newly elected President Roosevelt desperately launched the New Deal, and since then, the United States has begun to rise once more. The sleeping giant may soon awaken."

 ENG_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "After France surrendered in 1919, Britain’s will to continue the war collapsed, and it had no choice but to sign what Mosley called 'the most painful treaty in history.' That may have been an exaggeration—but most British citizens came to believe it. The Empire lost nothing in the treaty, yet was forced to acknowledge what was effectively a defeat. Since the 1920 armistice, Parliament has been dissolved three times. Even now, the government’s popularity has plummeted, while extremists and revolutionaries wait for their chance. Can they ever again become the empire on which the sun never sets?"

 FRA_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "France suffered the greatest blow in the Great War. In its aftermath, the country was left devastated, losing not only crucial and industrialized territories but also burdened with enormous reparations to Germany. The democratic government, mired in chaos, ultimately collapsed in Pétain’s coup, only to fall once again under the weight of the Great Depression and the Stavisky Affair. After a period of political fragmentation, the former French Popular Union led by Doriot and Déat seized power. However, political instability still lingers, and the looming threat of Germany continues to press a knife to France’s throat."
 
 GER_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Germany was able to prove it's greatness after defeating the Entente, it had become the hegemon of europe, africa and the seas of the world. But as germany had manifested it's rule over europe, the great depression of 1931 would hit, and devastate not only the economy but also the people, and while the Kaiser holds onto his constitutional power, political intability would reign over the so mighty german empire. And while it may hold onto its position, if the empire can survive the challenge soon to be laid onto it by the former Entente, reconstituted in the "National Entente", only time, blood and iron will tell."

 SOV_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Soviet Russia has been characterized by political turmoil, sloppy work, corruption, banditry and terror. After Lenin's Death, Sverdlov took over until he too suffered from various diseases and had to step down. In 1926, Kamenev was chosen to be the Head of the Supreme Soviet Presidium, as a "concession" candidate between the Militarists, Moderates, Internationalists and Left-Communists. On December 24th of 1935, Kamenev was shot by an unknown individual, and has since been bedridden, with his situation worsening everyday. Will the Revolution survive? Do the Ends justify the Means? Or will the Bolsheviks fall precisely as the Jacobins did?"

 AUH_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "The russians had tried to break up the multi-ethnic state that is Austria-Hungary, but as they had fallen into civil war, and the austro-hungarians would secure their empire by winning the great war, they were able to bring back some stability. But is it enough to hold the empire together? Many austrian supremacists call for a reconstiution of Austria-Hungary back into the Austrian Empire, the empire of the east, but many are for an extension of the crowns and a third, illyrian crown, it all lays in the hands of the Kaiser, he will decide the fate of the already unstable empire."

 TUR_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Similar to Austria-Hungary, the ottomans have various ethnicities and nations within their state, and reform needs to happen to ensure a continued peaceful cooperation between the ethnic groups, but two camps had formed, the Western Kemalists and the ottomanists, who are turkic supremacist, fundamentalists who want to smash arab autonomy, but as the Ottoman Empire is still economically weak and backwards, miltiarily a minor power and politically a powderkeg, either of them could lead to collapse or eternal glory, only time will really tell who will suceed."

 ITA_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Italy was one of the losers of World War I. They had to give Austria the northeastern lands. Vittorio Emmanuel III came down from the throne bearing the responsibility for the defeat, and Umberto II, who succeeded him, was also deposed shortly thereafter with the country's transformation into a republic. Since then, Italy has been in a state of extreme political turmoil, and the Great Depression of 1931 completely destroyed Italy's politics and economy. The national chaos became the growth engine of far-right integralist forces, which led to the party's landslide victory in the 1933 general election in Italy."

 SPR_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Spain is one of the few countries that escaped from the aftermath of the Great War. Born in 1935, the Second Republic of Spain has enormous internal turmoil caused by ideological conflicts. The election in February 1937 will determine Spain's future. In the run-up to this general election, internal conflict is deepening again, and maybe violence is the only way to end these conflicts."

 GRE_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "After World War I, Greece faced a series of very chaotic situations. Defeat in the Great War forced Greece to pay huge amounts of compensation, plus political and economic turmoil. Nevertheless, many people have a dream of recovering Goto, called "Megali Idea," and have a glimmer of hope."

 BUL_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "After three Balkan wars, Bulgaria became the sole hegemonic power of the Balkans. Serbia, competing with Bulgaria, became a vassal state of Austria-Hungary, and Greece fell with great defeat. But decades after World War I. Greece and Romania began to threaten Bulgaria. If there is no preparation for this, maybe Bulgaria will lose its war against them."

 JAP_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "The japanese were the only country in east asia to succesfully modernize, while still keeping the warrior tradition, the navy became the pride of the empire, but even winning in the first sino-japanese war and the russo-japanese war was not enough, as the entry into the great war would prove that japan was not yet ready, as they had lost the war, they had not lost any meaningful territory, but the spirit for revenge still helped in further radicalization, and the Showa financial crisis had paved the way for the full military take over, the emperor was allowed to stay, but he no longer had any real power. Will the military be able to fulfill japan's imperial goals?"

 FNG_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "The Fengtian Clique is the only Beiyang Clique that has survived from the Kuomintang Northern Expedition by the Nationalist Party in the past. It succeeded in preventing the Kuomintang Army with the help of Japan and Germany, especially Germany, but as Japan's influence inside the Fengtian grew, Germany began to help Kuomintang, not the Fengtian. Amid the ongoing dispute between the two warlords – the Fengtian government and the Kuomintang Government – over the mainland China – the question of who will succeed in unifying China is at argument for many political and diplomatic scholars."

 CHI_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Sun Yat-sen realized his dream of becoming a republic on the continent in 1911. However, the dream of a democratic republic ended with the reality of Yuan Shai and the warlords era. Nonetheless, Challenge of Sun Yat-sen to establish a true republic came to a climax in the, Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition. However, foreign powers interfered, and China was divided into two governments. The failure of the northern expedition also significantly weakened Chiang Kai-shek's position. However, the Kuomintang's will to invade the North is still firmly established, and they want to unify China by any means."

 SAF_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Britain was defeated in the Great War. By the treaty between Britain and Central Powers, South Africa separated from the Commonwealth and became a republic. However, this deeply racist country is fostering a serious division between British-South Africans, Boers, blacks and Collard. It is making our country very dangerous."

 CAN_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Despite its participation in the World War, Canada was not significantly affected by the long distance from its main battlefields. However, the Great Depression and the collapse of Britain's economy, as a suzerain state, caused significant disruption in Canadian society and led to the expansion of groups with radical ideas. Section 98 of the Criminal Code prevented extremist forces from participating in politics, but the Canadian society is still uneasy."
 
 RUS_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "§RThe country becomes playable after the German-Soviet War breaks out while you're playing as Soviet Russia.§!\nThe Russian Republic has faded into history, but a number of White Russian generals remained, and they left Russia to form various organizations of their own. The Russian All-Military Union, founded by Pyotr Brangel and now led by General Arkhangelsky, was one such organization. Now they were waiting in the shadows for the day when they could take down the Soviet. And then the opportunity came: the German-Soviet War. They founded a new organization, the League of All-Russian Liberation, to work with the Germans to take down the Bolsheviks."
