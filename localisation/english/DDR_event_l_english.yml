 east_ermany.1.t:0 "A Grim Reality After the Soviet Advance"
 east_ermany.1.d:0 "From the moment the Soviet Army pushed into eastern Germany, the region has descended into near-total collapse. The chaotic retreat of the Imperial German Army and the brutal urban battles left towns and farmlands in ashes. Those who survived now find themselves without shelter, food, or any means to sustain daily life.\n\nIn the cities, supply lines have been severed and food distribution has effectively ceased. Starvation is spreading rapidly, and countless families can no longer feed their children. The occupying forces attempt to restore order, but after months of disruption the administrative system has practically ceased to function. Soviet officers and provisional administrators struggle to clear the ruins and reestablish basic governance, but the devastation is so extensive that most efforts fail to produce lasting results.\n\nMeanwhile, an unending stream of refugees flees westward. As news of the Soviet advance spread, thousands of civilians abandoned their homes and began walking along the roads with whatever belongings they could carry. Many trek dozens of kilometers with minimal supplies; exhaustion, malnutrition, and illness take their toll along the way. Bodies are found on the roadside, some left unburied as the sheer scale overwhelms the survivors.\n\nThis situation has surpassed the bounds of ordinary wartime destruction. It represents the systematic collapse of an entire society. The revolutionary authorities now face the monumental task of stabilizing the region and rebuilding eastern Germany, though it is unclear where to even begin. Amid despair, fear, and chaos, the people of Germany endure each day simply in an attempt to survive."

 east_ermany.2.t:0 "Total Administrative Paralysis"
 east_ermany.2.d:0 "Following the Soviet advance and the collapse of the Imperial German Army, the administrative structure of eastern Germany has effectively ceased to function. Intensive combat, hasty retreats, and the destruction of government buildings created a rapid administrative vacuum. Most remaining civil servants have fled or gone into hiding, leaving virtually no functioning local institutions.\n\nTax offices, food distribution centers, registry bureaus, and policing authorities have either been destroyed or stripped of all records and equipment. Many administrative departments, already overstretched even before the war, have collapsed entirely under the pressure. With every ledger burned and every archive reduced to ashes, restarting governance is proving far more difficult than the revolutionary government ever anticipated.\n\nSoviet administrators and revolutionary officials attempt to restore minimal services, but the daily influx of thousands of refugees and starving civilians overwhelms every effort. Without reliable records, even the simplest food distribution becomes chaotic, and in some regions the lack of documentation has sparked distrust and violence among the population.\n\nPublic order is also deteriorating. Former Imperial soldiers, desperate civilians, and organized looters roam the countryside, while the limited Soviet military police forces struggle to maintain control. With local institutions gone, many areas rely entirely on improvised self-administration by villages, factories, or peasant committees.\n\nThe task facing the revolutionary government is far greater than mere administrative repair. It is the reconstruction of an entire state structure from the ground up—politically, economically, and socially. Yet without restoring basic governance, no reforms can be enforced, and no socialist reconstruction can begin. The government is now burdened with the monumental responsibility of rebuilding a functioning administrative system from the ruins."

 east_ermany.3.t:0 "Thaelmann Has Returned"
 east_ermany.3.d:0 "Amid the chaos of war and the collapse of the old Empire, countless Germans wandered through a landscape stripped of order and purpose. Administration had fallen apart, villages lay abandoned, the people starved, and the remnants of the defeated regime crumbled without dignity. Even the new authorities struggled to maintain confidence in their own project. Yet today, an unexpected message spread through the ruins of eastern Germany: Ernst Thaelmann, long absent and believed lost by many, has returned.\n\nThaelmann, who survived imprisonment, forced labor, exile, and clandestine struggle, has once again set foot on German soil. His first address to the liberated populace was calm yet strikingly firm. He reminded the people how imperial and feudal forces had oppressed them for generations and declared that now was the moment for the working class to seize the direction of history. Above all, he emphasized that the revolution was not a government project alone, but the collective endeavor of the people themselves.\n\nHis words breathed unexpected strength into the war-weary. Workers drifting into political nihilism, peasants contemplating escape, and youths who had lost all sense of direction suddenly found a renewed spark of hope. Thaelmann's very presence serves not merely as a political figure, but as a powerful symbol, reinvigorating the emerging idea of a 'Red Germany' with legitimacy and momentum.\n\nEven in Moscow and within the Soviet military administration, his return is received with cautious optimism. Thaelmann has long held a degree of trust within the international revolutionary movement, and there is speculation that he may provide the stability and leadership needed to guide Germany out of its current crisis. Within the revolutionary government, talk has already begun about integrating him into a unified leadership structure.\n\nUnexpected though his return may be, the people of Germany are starting to understand that their future is not yet lost. And at the center of this newfound hope stands the name Thaelmann."

 east_ermany.4.t:0 "Reorganizing the Party with the Left"
 east_ermany.4.d:0 "After Thaelmann's return, the left-wing political landscape of eastern Germany began to show signs of rapid realignment. The old party structures had already collapsed under the weight of war, imperial defeat, occupation, and administrative paralysis. The era in which the Social Democrats and Communists pointed guns at each other instead of at their common enemies seemed, at least for the moment, to have ended. Within this turmoil, the revolutionary government and Thaelmann's circle saw an opportunity.\n\nThey focused their attention on the radicals and left-wing elements within the Social Democratic ranks—those who had long been marginalized. Even before the war, these figures had advocated socialization, workers' control, and a consistent anti-imperialist line, only to be pushed aside by the compromises and half-measures of the moderate leadership. Now, with the Empire gone and the old leaders discredited or disappeared, these neglected voices finally had a chance to be heard.\n\nThrough a series of discreet meetings, Thaelmann and his comrades proposed a bold plan: to overcome the old split and form a new united left. The idea was to bring the radical Social Democrats and the existing Communists together into a reorganized Communist Party—or, more broadly, a unified socialist workers' party that could serve as the genuine political foundation of the revolutionary government. The discussions were heated, often turning into harsh critiques and painful recollections of past betrayals and fratricidal violence.\n\nYet, many participants ultimately acknowledged that there was no path forward in preserving the old divide. To truly abolish the imperial-feudal order and rebuild a new socialist Germany from the ruins, the left could not afford to scatter its strength. The notion took hold that the radical elements of the Social Democrats should no longer pretend to be a 'third way', but step forward as a full part of the revolutionary movement.\n\nToday, a first agreement has finally been drafted. A significant number of Social Democratic radicals and leftists have decided to join a reorganized Communist Party under Thaelmann's leadership. This is more than a simple influx of new members; it marks the beginning of a deeper recomposition of the German left as a whole. There remain many obstacles and unresolved tensions, but for the first time in a long while, there is a cautious sense near the heart of the revolutionary government that, once again, the left might be learning how to fight together."
 east_ermany.4.a:0 "Now we truly need a single revolutionary party."
 east_ermany.5.t:0 "A Way Out of the Administrative Hell"
 east_ermany.5.d:0 "Despite the revolutionary government's best efforts to rebuild the collapsed administrative system, the situation remains dire. A single form can take days to process, no functioning offices remain to issue ration cards, and entire regions still lack any form of resident registry. Even if the people are enthusiastic about the revolution, no reform can be implemented when the basic machinery of governance has completely stopped. A new source of administrative expertise has become desperately necessary.\n\nIt was under these conditions that a proposal—unspoken for weeks but increasingly unavoidable—emerged within the leadership: to bring back a selection of former Imperial bureaucrats. These individuals, though complicit in sustaining the old corrupt and feudal order, are nonetheless the only people who still possess practical experience in running an administration. The idea appears to conflict with revolutionary ideals, yet the situation in eastern Germany is far too severe to ignore the reality.\n\nSome members of the revolutionary government protested strongly. "Why should we rely on the very people who served the Empire?" they argued, raising concerns that these bureaucrats could become a latent reactionary threat. However, others countered with more pragmatic reasoning: "If the administration collapses, the revolution collapses with it. What we need right now are capable hands—their past allegiance no longer matters."\n\nAfter days of tense discussions, the government decided to rehire a limited number of former Imperial administrators to assist with the reconstruction of the bureaucratic apparatus. It is by no means a glorious revolutionary triumph, but it is undeniably a necessary step. Some citizens view this with suspicion, but many others simply hope for the return of functioning state services and welcome any measure that achieves it.\n\nThe revolutionary leadership has emphasized that this cooperation is temporary and that these officials will ultimately be replaced by a new socialist cadre. Yet for now, in order to revive even the faintest pulse of governance amidst the ruins, this contradictory and unorthodox decision may be the only path forward."
 east_ermany.5.a:0 "If it is necessary, even remnants of the past can serve the revolution."
 east_ermany.6.t:0 "Germany Is Safe, Citizens"
 east_ermany.6.d:0 "In the aftermath of war, the Soviet advance, administrative paralysis, refugee columns, and recurring food shortages, the people of eastern Germany have lived in a state of constant fear and uncertainty. Rumors and misinformation spread unchecked across towns and villages, and with no reliable source of truth, anxiety only continued to grow. Faced with this situation, the revolutionary government concluded that public sentiment could no longer be left to deteriorate on its own.\n\nThis morning, through a series of major radio broadcasts, posters, and local assemblies, the provisional administration issued an official message to the population. The core statement was simple yet emphatic: \"Germany is safe. Citizens, do not be afraid. The Soviet Union is our ally and a partner in liberation.\" The government stressed that the Soviet forces were not occupiers seeking domination, but comrades-in-arms working together to eliminate the remnants of imperialism and help construct a new socialist order.\n\nOf course, the truth remains far more complex. Security is still fragile, and misunderstandings between local residents and Soviet soldiers occur frequently. Food distribution is not yet fully restored, and the corrupted structures of the old Imperial bureaucracy continue to hinder progress in many regions. The government is well aware of these issues, but at this moment, calming the frightened populace has become an urgent necessity.\n\nReactions among the people vary. Some feel reassured, muttering, "Perhaps things really will improve soon," while others dismiss the announcement as yet another piece of propaganda. Nevertheless, the anxious whispers that once filled the streets have begun to fade, and there are early signs that basic order and daily life may slowly be returning.\n\nThe revolutionary government has pledged to continue direct communication with the people to ensure that this message of reassurance does not dissipate quickly. Restoring public trust will take far more than a single announcement—but for today, at least, a faint sense of stability has begun to spread across the ruins."

 east_ermany.18.t:0 "The Question of the Aristocracy"
 east_ermany.18.d:0 "One of the most delicate tasks before the revolutionary government is the handling of the German aristocracy. Even in the collapse of the feudal Empire and amidst the ruins of war, many nobles attempted to preserve their vast estates and privileged status. Now that socialist Germany is establishing a new order, we must decide their fate.\n\nThe first option is to arrest and forcibly 're-educate' all aristocrats. It is a thorough, uncompromising measure that would satisfy hardline revolutionaries, but it risks short-term administrative disruption and social backlash.\n\nThe second option is to confiscate all aristocratic property and strip them of status, reducing them to ordinary citizens. It is a moderate, practical solution that avoids extremes while providing land and resources to peasants and workers.\n\nThe final option is to allow a small number of nobles who actively cooperated with the revolution to keep their family names and minor prestige. While this may seem lenient, it could lead to surprising outcomes."

 east_ermany.19.t:0 "The Curious Logic of Count Wilhelm von Orzen"
 east_ermany.19.d:0 "When we decided to allow a handful of cooperative nobles to keep their titles and a semblance of prestige, it was widely seen as a lukewarm compromise at best. Most assumed we had simply chosen a slightly less brutal way of dealing with the relics of the old order. Even among revolutionaries, the decision was tolerated only as a pragmatic retreat in the face of reality.\n\nWhat no one anticipated, however, was the appearance—and unexpected influence—of a certain nobleman known as Count Wilhelm von Orzen. At official functions and private gatherings alike, he has taken to introducing himself with a peculiar turn of phrase: \"We are not Junkers, but self-sufficient farmers!\" At first, this sounded like nothing more than an oddly desperate joke, a clumsy attempt to excuse his class origins.\n\nYet, against all expectations, this half-joking statement began to spread through aristocratic circles. Orzen cleverly twists the narrative, claiming that he and his peers are no longer parasitic feudal lords, but responsible stewards who must now devote their land and resources to the benefit of the people and the new socialist order. \"We do not live off the people; we cultivate the fields alongside them,\" he insists—and somehow, this strange line of reasoning has started to resonate.\n\nMore and more nobles have begun to see themselves as 'reformed, self-reliant landholders' within the new system rather than enemies of it. The phrase \"We are not Junkers, but self-sufficient farmers\" has turned into a kind of running joke—repeated in salons, in taverns, and even on the streets—but its political effect is no joke at all. As Count Orzen continues his bizarre campaign, nobles line up to profess loyalty to the new government, and public sentiment toward the regime grows unexpectedly warm.\n\nNone of this was planned, and any serious theorist of revolution would be hard-pressed to explain it. Yet, in this strange and almost comical way, the hearts of both the aristocracy and the common people are steadily drifting toward our side."
 east_ermany.19.a:0 "Unexpected, but certainly welcome."
 east_ermany.20.t:0 "A New Intelligence Service Gone Too Far"
 east_ermany.20.d:0 "As the revolutionary government struggled to restore order, the need for a centralized intelligence apparatus became increasingly urgent. With reactionary remnants, rogue Imperial officers, armed gangs, and foreign-backed elements destabilizing the region, a dedicated security service was deemed essential. Thus, the new Ministry for State Security—soon nicknamed the Stasi—was established, with several Soviet and KGB liaison officers assigned to assist in its formation.\n\nThe problem was not that the Stasi failed to develop. The problem was that it developed far too quickly—and far too aggressively.\n\nWithin weeks of its founding, the Stasi had somehow created its own internal departments, surveillance divisions, investigative offices, and document management systems. Then it began confidently approaching the KGB liaison team demanding "data-sharing agreements," "training equipment," and "support for recruitment expansion." At first, the Soviets assumed this was an overenthusiastic administrative request—until they saw the reports.\n\nThe Stasi had already installed a dense surveillance network across all of eastern Germany and had planted informants in government offices, factories, farms, railway crews, youth groups, and even revolutionary committees. Even more astonishing was the revelation that, despite being a newborn institution, it had quietly drafted plans to send 'preliminary agents' into West Germany and the Allied occupation zones.\n\nOne KGB officer reportedly stared at the Stasi's operational map in silence before muttering:\n\n"...This is more extensive than our own early networks."\n\nThe Soviet command was taken aback by the sheer ambition and speed at which the Stasi was expanding. Where they expected to provide guidance and oversight, they now found themselves wondering whether this infant organization was growing into something far more formidable than anticipated.\n\nFor the revolutionary government, the situation is both impressive and slightly alarming. The newfound intelligence reach is undeniably useful amid the chaos—but the fact that even the KGB is unsettled by the Stasi's enthusiasm speaks volumes."

 east_ermany.21.t:0 "A Young Nurse at a Crossroad"
 east_ermany.21.d:0 "Every morning at five, her hands stung from the cold as she left her small apartment and walked toward the hospital. Yet she never forgot to smile—because she was, at last, a nurse. No matter how chilly the dawn air was, the scent of disinfectant in the ward felt like the finest perfume to her. She had always wanted this path. Her mother had taken her own life, her father had drifted through affairs, and she had repeatedly failed the nursing exams. But after the Empire's collapse, the new government—desperate for medical staff—opened its doors wide, and she stepped through. At long last, she earned the title she had dreamed of.\n\n"Comrade Anna, truly impressive! The whole ward needs you!" Head nurse Clara greeted her with a bright smile. The word 'comrade' still felt strange, but not unpleasant. Ideologically, she was lukewarm. She did not know what Marx or Lenin meant for her life. Still, she was grateful to the system that finally allowed her to become a nurse, and offering a respectful nod to their portraits in the hallway was hardly difficult.\n\nDuring lunch, a rumor spread among the staff. Promotion to senior nurse came with bonus points for FDJ membership. Even transfers to the larger, modern hospital in central Königsberg were said to favor FDJ members first. She liked her current workplace, but she also dreamed of working somewhere larger—somewhere she could help more patients.\n\nAfter work, she sat at her table as darkness gathered outside. Under the warm light of the small lamp, she carefully unfolded the FDJ application form. She was not certain about ideology, but the opportunity laid plainly in front of her. Pen in hand, she hesitated. It was just a sheet of paper—but it felt like a crossroads that might shape her entire future."

 east_ermany.22.d:0 "Although the revolutionary government is steadily establishing a new socialist order, remnants of Imperial elements and right-wing extremist forces continue to threaten public safety across East Germany. Recent sabotage attempts have increased anxiety among the population, and the government recognizes the need for a comprehensive response.\n\nTo address this, the government has launched a major propaganda campaign, officially honoring those who resist extremism as the "Great Fighters Against Extremism." Members of the Militarized People's Police, factory militias, local defense committees, and politically conscious citizens are all portrayed as frontline defenders of the revolution and the people. They are praised as "the shield of the people who stand firm against extremism and the pillars of a new Red Germany."\n\nRadio broadcasts, posters, school assemblies, and workplace meetings highlight specific examples of their heroic actions. Guards who stopped attacks, workers who reported sabotage, and local patrols who captured fleeing extremists are all celebrated as exemplary individuals safeguarding national stability. The campaign emphasizes that combating extremism is not an individual heroic act but a collective socialist duty shared by the entire population.\n\nThe revolutionary government expects this campaign to strengthen social unity and further isolate remaining extremist forces. While threats still exist, more citizens are gaining confidence in their ability to build a safer and more stable society together."

 east_ermany.24.d:0 "The revolutionary government has formally defined the mission and status of the new National People's Army. The force is organized without any remnants or traditions of the former Imperial military, functioning strictly as a formation created by the revolutionary authorities.\n\nIts first task is to act as the foremost frontline force against Western France, serving as the revolutionary vanguard confronting Western political and military pressure. Its second task is to serve as the primary formation ready for sacrifice if necessary to protect the people and the revolution.\n\nThe army exists not to preserve honor or legacy, but to operate precisely according to the needs and directives of the revolutionary government. All personnel therefore undergo ideological training alongside military discipline.\n\nWith this declaration, the National People's Army is formally designated as the vanguard standing against Western France."
 east_ermany.24.a:0 "We are the vanguard."
 east_ermany.25.t:0 "Complete Political Unification of the Left"
 east_ermany.25.d:0 "The revolutionary government has reached a final decision to enforce a full organizational and political consolidation of all left-wing forces operating within East Germany. This measure extends far beyond a simple merger or cooperation. It encompasses the Communist Party, the left faction of the Social Democrats, revolutionary elements within the trade unions, socialist youth groups, and numerous regional radical circles, all of which will be absorbed into a single unified structure.\n\nThe government has judged that the continued fragmentation of these groups produces unnecessary administrative overlap and internal friction, ultimately obstructing the construction of the new socialist state. Independent decision-making bodies scattered across multiple organizations have slowed the implementation of revolutionary policy and weakened unity among the people. For this reason, all separate organizational identities are formally dissolved, and all cadres and members are placed under a unified discipline, unified line, and unified structure.\n\nThe restructuring of agendas, leadership systems, and ideological training procedures is already underway. The new framework—spanning from local committees to central organizational authority—replaces the old pattern of competing voices with a single movement aligned under one purpose. Radical elements within labor unions will now be incorporated into the political structure, the left wing of the Social Democrats relinquishes its separate policy stance, and smaller socialist groups cease independent activity altogether and will be reassigned under unified leadership.\n\nThis measure ensures that all left-wing forces share a single political center of gravity. The revolutionary government declares this consolidation an essential step toward building the new socialist order. The left is no longer a collection of scattered factions, but a unified body organized under a single banner: the Socialist Unity Party.\n\nThe government characterizes today's unification decree as a turning point in reorganizing the entire left under the revolutionary system."
