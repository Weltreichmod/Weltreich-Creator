 GER_idea_Wilhelm_Marx:0 "Chancellor Wilhelm Marx"
 GER_idea_Wilhelm_Marx_desc:0 "Chancellor Wilhelm Marx has long opposed military interference in politics, viewing it as a threat to civilian rule. Since taking office, he has worked tirelessly to rein in the armed forces, asserting government authority over their affairs. Yet, his efforts have only bred resentment. Discontent festers within the ranks, and in shadowed halls, plans take shape—plans to see Marx removed from power."

 GER_idea_Hjalmar_Schacht_desc:0 "Hjalmar Schacht, the architect of Germany's swift recovery from the Great Depression, sees the world shifting—and with it, the need for change. An economist first and foremost, he understands that old policies cannot sustain a new era. Now, as Germany's diplomatic chancellor, he stands ready to chart a new course, one that will redefine the empire's place in the world."
 GER_idea_Maximilian_von_Baden:0 "Chancellor Gerhard Tappen"
 GER_idea_Maximilian_von_Baden_desc:0 "Gerhard Tappen stands as a voice of the military, a firm believer in rule by strength and the iron fist of order. To him, power is not meant to be tempered but wielded without hesitation. Has history not proven that the German way—the true way—is to crush all who stand in opposition?"

Though the Empire possessed vast colonial holdings, poor administration and ignorance turned what were once considered assets into burdens.

 sour_loser:0 "Sour Loser"
 sour_loser_desc:0 "Defeat hangs over the nation like a specter, its shadow long and bitter. The Great War was lost, and with it, France's pride and ambition were shattered.

The war may be over, but the desire for retribution burns hotter than ever."

The shame of the Great War lingers in every shattered industry and every faded imperial map, a wound that refuses to heal. In the chaos, Oswald Mosley's British Union of Integralists rises, draped in black and promising renewal. To the desperate and the disillusioned, his words are not just rhetoric—they are a path to reclaim lost glory."

Yet, while the Kaiser championed a trialist monarchy—elevating a unified South Slav kingdom—the Hungarians clung to the dualist system, unwilling to cede an inch of their authority. Since then, opposition has hardened into defiance, with Budapest resisting Vienna at every turn, not out of reason, but out of sheer principle."

 CHL_the_ibanist_dictatorship_desc:0 "In 1936, General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo's dictatorship still dominates Chile, shaping the country into a tightly controlled, authoritarian state. Under his rule, industrial growth has surged, but political freedoms have all but vanished, with opposition silenced and dissent swiftly crushed. Chile's close alliance with Imperial Germany, victorious in World War I, has deeply influenced the nation's military and economic policies, fostering a rigid, militaristic society. As democratic movements gain traction elsewhere in Latin America, Chile remains isolated, committed to its nationalist ideals and firmly aligned with Germany's authoritarian world order, showing no signs of a return to democracy."
 CHL_la_hacienda:0 "La Hacienda"
 CHL_la_hacienda_desc:0 "Haciendas remain powerful symbols of the entrenched social hierarchy and economic inequality. These vast rural estates, controlled by an elite class of landowners loyal to the authoritarian regime, dominate the agricultural landscape, producing vital resources for both domestic use and export, particularly to Imperial Germany. The hacienda system perpetuates a feudal-like structure, with peasant laborers, or inquilinos, working the land in harsh conditions for minimal wages, while landowners maintain absolute control, backed by the state's military and police forces. The regime's support for the hacienda owners ensures that this agrarian elite remains a key pillar of Ibáñez's rule, further entrenching a rigid class divide that isolates rural workers from the growing urban and revolutionary movements."

 CHL_FLN_terorism_desc:0 "The Frente de Liberación Nacional Luis Emilio Recabarren (FLN) is a clandestine communist group formed in retaliation to the assassination of socialist leader Luis Emilio Recabarren by the Ibáñez dictatorship. Founded in the late 1920s, the FLN is dedicated to overthrowing the authoritarian regime of Carlos Ibáñez del Campo and avenging Recabarren's death through acts of violence. They carry out sporadic terrorist attacks, including bombings and assassinations of key political figures aligned with the regime, such as the infamous killing of former minister Alberto Edwards Vives. The FLN's radical actions are driven by Marxist ideology, aiming to destabilize the government and ignite a revolutionary movement, despite heavy repression and relentless government crackdowns."
 CHL_aftermath_of_great_depression:0 "Aftermath Of The Great Depression"
 CHL_aftermath_of_great_depression_desc:0 "By 1936, Chile is still reeling from the devastating effects of the Great Depression, which struck the world after the financial collapse in a victorious post-war Germany. Chile's economy, closely tied to German markets and heavily reliant on exports like copper and nitrate, was hit particularly hard as demand plummeted. The rural poor and urban working class bear the brunt of the crisis, with unemployment and poverty at record highs. The Ibáñez regime, in its characteristic authoritarian fashion, has responded by tightening control, enforcing harsh labor conditions, and prioritizing industrial sectors vital to its alliance with Germany. Despite the government's attempts to maintain stability, discontent simmers across the country, with strikes, food shortages, and protests becoming more frequent. Revolutionary groups like the FLN grow stronger as they exploit the widespread dissatisfaction, and the social order in Chile appears increasingly fragile as economic despair spreads."

The immense industrial weight of the Ruhr and Rhineland not only overshadows the Belgian market but, through finance, railways, and trade, Germany has also institutionalized control over Belgium's key industries. Belgian firms and factories can scarcely survive without German capital, leading to economic decline and the severe curtailing of national choice.

In reality, however, it stands in a subordinate position under the economic and diplomatic pressure of the German Empire. The Belgian government claims autonomy, but in matters of foreign policy, military affairs, and even industry, it cannot escape Germany's shadow.

Communication with their families is forbidden, all research is subject to censorship, and every discovery is published under French names. Some pretend to cooperate willingly, but fear and exhaustion linger in their eyes. They are no longer German scholars, but exiles and captives living in the shadow of France.\n\nStill, their brilliance has propelled France's technological capabilities to new heights.

President Song Jiaoren, whose political base largely rested upon the support of farmers, sought to resolve the outdated land distribution system inherited from the Qing by advocating for the principle of 'land to the tiller' and promoting a comprehensive agrarian reform. However, his sudden assassination brought all of his ambitious reforms to an abrupt halt. Though the reform itself was never formally repealed, it has seen virtually no progress since his death in 1924, gradually calcifying into a relic of a bygone era.\n\nMost farmland in the country is still owned by landlords, who lease it to tenant farmers at steep rates. Song Jiaoren's reform proposal challenged this landlord system but, in doing so, inadvertently left behind an incomplete and contradictory framework.

To fill these gaps, the government granted official status to various semi-military groups and vigilante units — or, less charitably, to local warlords — under the title of 'Volunteer Corps.' In the early days of the Republic, when everything was lacking, this policy appeared practical enough.\n\nYet in recent years, many so-called 'Volunteer Corps' have become little more than petty warlord armies hiding behind a respectable name.

By 1931, Britain abandoned the gold standard, prompting China to consider a shift toward a managed currency regime as well.
