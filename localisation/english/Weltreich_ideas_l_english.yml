 GER_idea_Wilhelm_Marx:0 "Chancellor Wilhelm Marx"
 GER_idea_Wilhelm_Marx_desc:0 "Chancellor Wilhelm Marx has long opposed military interference in politics, viewing it as a threat to civilian rule. Since taking office, he has worked tirelessly to rein in the armed forces, asserting government authority over their affairs. Yet, his efforts have only bred resentment. Discontent festers within the ranks, and in shadowed halls, plans take shape—plans to see Marx removed from power."

 GER_idea_political_turmoil_desc:0 "Chaos grips the halls of power. Factions clash, alliances fracture, and stability crumbles beneath the weight of discord. The government stands, but only barely—adrift in a storm of political turmoil with no clear course forward."

 GER_idea_Hjalmar_Schacht_desc:0 "Hjalmar Schacht, the architect of Germany’s swift recovery from the Great Depression, sees the world shifting—and with it, the need for change. An economist first and foremost, he understands that old policies cannot sustain a new era. Now, as Germany’s diplomatic chancellor, he stands ready to chart a new course, one that will redefine the empire’s place in the world."
 GER_idea_Maximilian_von_Baden:0 "Chancellor Gerhard Tappen"
 GER_idea_Maximilian_von_Baden_desc:0 "Gerhard Tappen stands as a voice of the military, a firm believer in rule by strength and the iron fist of order. To him, power is not meant to be tempered but wielded without hesitation. Has history not proven that the German way—the true way—is to crush all who stand in opposition?"

 sour_loser:0 "Sour Loser"
 sour_loser_desc:0 "Defeat hangs over the nation like a specter, its shadow long and bitter. The Great War was lost, and with it, France’s pride and ambition were shattered.

The war may be over, but the desire for retribution burns hotter than ever."

The shame of the Great War lingers in every shattered industry and every faded imperial map, a wound that refuses to heal. In the chaos, Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists rises, draped in black and promising renewal. To the desperate and the disillusioned, his words are not just rhetoric—they are a path to reclaim lost glory."

 an_unpopular_government_desc:0 "The government stands, but only just. With little support from the people, its foundation is brittle, swaying under the weight of discontent.

Yet, while the Kaiser championed a trialist monarchy—elevating a unified South Slav kingdom—the Hungarians clung to the dualist system, unwilling to cede an inch of their authority.

The Grand Duchy exists only as long as it serves German interests, and should Vasyl von Habsburg step out of line, he would be replaced in an instant. To cement their grip, Berlin has settled thousands of German veterans across the land, granting them estates carved from Ukrainian soil. A new aristocracy of German officers and administrators slowly but steadily tightens its hold, pushing native elites aside as the Grand Duke watches helplessly. After the war, Germany saw Pavlo Skoropadskyi as a danger to their goals of making Ukraine their client state and the breadbasket of Germany, serving only German interests, which could not be achieved under his leadership. This led to a German-sponsored coup in 1919, replacing him with Vasyl von Habsburg. Germany remembers the hunger of the Depression and knows Ukraine’s vast grain fields, the breadbasket of the Reich, are key to preventing such a catastrophe from happening again. For the Reich, losing Ukraine is unthinkable—and it will stop at nothing to keep its grip, no matter the cost."

Anti-German and anti-Habsburg sentiment festers in the streets, whispered in darkened taverns and muttered in the fields. Vasyl von Habsburg stands upon a crumbling throne, ruling a land that loathes him. Any misstep, any sign of weakness, and the Grand Duchy will fall like a house of cards."

 CHL_the_ibanist_dictatorship_desc:0 "In 1936, General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo's dictatorship still dominates Chile, shaping the country into a tightly controlled, authoritarian state. Under his rule, industrial growth has surged, but political freedoms have all but vanished, with opposition silenced and dissent swiftly crushed. Chile’s close alliance with Imperial Germany, victorious in World War I, has deeply influenced the nation's military and economic policies, fostering a rigid, militaristic society. As democratic movements gain traction elsewhere in Latin America, Chile remains isolated, committed to its nationalist ideals and firmly aligned with Germany’s authoritarian world order, showing no signs of a return to democracy."
 CHL_la_hacienda:0 "La Hacienda"
 CHL_la_hacienda_desc:0 "Haciendas remain powerful symbols of the entrenched social hierarchy and economic inequality. These vast rural estates, controlled by an elite class of landowners loyal to the authoritarian regime, dominate the agricultural landscape, producing vital resources for both domestic use and export, particularly to Imperial Germany. The hacienda system perpetuates a feudal-like structure, with peasant laborers, or inquilinos, working the land in harsh conditions for minimal wages, while landowners maintain absolute control, backed by the state’s military and police forces. The regime's support for the hacienda owners ensures that this agrarian elite remains a key pillar of Ibáñez’s rule, further entrenching a rigid class divide that isolates rural workers from the growing urban and revolutionary movements."

Founded in the late 1920s, the FLN is dedicated to overthrowing the authoritarian regime of Carlos Ibáñez del Campo and avenging Recabarren’s death through acts of violence. They carry out sporadic terrorist attacks, including bombings and assassinations of key political figures aligned with the regime, such as the infamous killing of former minister Alberto Edwards Vives. The FLN's radical actions are driven by Marxist ideology, aiming to destabilize the government and ignite a revolutionary movement, despite heavy repression and relentless government crackdowns."
 CHL_aftermath_of_great_depression:0 "Aftermath Of The Great Depression"
 CHL_aftermath_of_great_depression_desc:0 "By 1936, Chile is still reeling from the devastating effects of the Great Depression, which struck the world after the financial collapse in a victorious post-war Germany. Chile’s economy, closely tied to German markets and heavily reliant on exports like copper and nitrate, was hit particularly hard as demand plummeted. The rural poor and urban working class bear the brunt of the crisis, with unemployment and poverty at record highs. The Ibáñez regime, in its characteristic authoritarian fashion, has responded by tightening control, enforcing harsh labor conditions, and prioritizing industrial sectors vital to its alliance with Germany. Despite the government’s attempts to maintain stability, discontent simmers across the country, with strikes, food shortages, and protests becoming more frequent. Revolutionary groups like the FLN grow stronger as they exploit the widespread dissatisfaction, and the social order in Chile appears increasingly fragile as economic despair spreads."
