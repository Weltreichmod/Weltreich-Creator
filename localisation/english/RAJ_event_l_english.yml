 india.1.d:0 "After the fall of the British Empire at the hands of its enemies, British India was thrown into chaos. There was a mass exodus of British subjects, and areas of the country that were normally unhappy with British rule saw mass beatings and killings of British subjects.\n\nIn addition to the persecution of the British, the thirst of Hindus and Muslims for power was also driven to extremes. In the midst of this chaos, India was torn apart, and the pearl of the British crown was split."
