 britain.1.t:0 "King George V Dies"
 britain.1.d:0 "His Majesty, George V, King of United Kingdom and the British Dominions and Emperor of India has passed away. His quiet calm and devotion to his subjects saw the Empire through both the Great War and the Great Depression. His son will assume the mantle as King Edward VIII, but there are already concerns that he will be too independent of thought. Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain are preparing to ensure that he will accept direction from the Prime Minister and the Cabinet."
 britain.1.a:0 "May He Rest in Peace"
 britain.2.t:0 "King Edward Abdicates"
 britain.2.d:0 "Prime Minister has made it quite clear that the dignity of the King-Emperor will be impinged if he were to marry not just a commoner, but also a divorcée and if that was not bad enough, an American. After much soul searching his majesty has chosen love over duty and has chosen to abdicate. His younger brother, Albert, will assume the mantle as King George VI. London bookmakers are already taking odds on whether this shy man will make it to his own coronation."
 britain.2.a:0 "God Save King George VI"
 britain.3.t:0 "General Election in 1936"
 britain.3.d:0 "In June of 1936, the general election was held in England. Now that the Integralist Party is very popular in Britain, it seems unlikely that the Democratic Party will be able to regain power. The winner of this general election is..."
 britain.3.a:0 "Conservative Party won by a narrow margin."
 britain.3.b:0 "Oswald Moseley's British Union of Integralists won."
 britain.3.c:0 "The communist CPGB won."
 britain.4.t:0 "Alliance with France"
 britain.4.d:0 "The French government expressed its desire to form an alliance with us. So maybe an alliance between these two is necessary to counter Germany."
 britain.4.a:0 "That's a good idea."
 britain.4.b:0 "Never."
 britain.5.t:0 "Franco British Nonaggression Treaty"
 britain.5.d:0 "The French have contacted us to sign a nonaggression treaty. They have the purpose of punishing Germany like we do. Maybe in the future we'll be a good ally."
 britain.5.a:0 "Good."
 britain.5.b:0 "Well... I don't think so."
 britain.6.t:0 "Victory of the Conservative Party"
 britain.6.d:0 "Contrary to everyone's expectations, Britain's Conservatives won the general election. The Communist Party of England and the Integralist Alliance have been continuing their criticism of the election fraud. Although they won the general election, it remains to be seen whether Britain's new government will be able to maintain power. Rather, as a result of this election, British society may fall into extreme chaos."
 britain.6.a:0 "No way!"
 britain.7.t:0 "Oswald Moseley takes power"
 britain.7.d:0 "As expected, the British Conservative Party lost the general election disastrously. Britain's new government was made up of a British integralist coalition led by Oswald Moseley. Now that one of the far-right parties, the British Integralist Union, has come to power in Britain, there are debates everywhere about what path the Integralist Britain will take. Maybe we'll have World War again."
 britain.7.a:0 "It's comming..."
 britain.8.t:0 "Victory of the Communist Party of Britain"
 britain.8.d:0 "It turned out that the winner of the recent British general election was the Communist Party of England. The rule of the Communist Party, which has advocated the abolition of the royal family and status system, is expected to greatly change the order of the British Empire. British capitalists and many politicians now disapprove of the Communist Party's rule, and perhaps we're on the verge of the end of a centuries-old British royal family."
 britain.8.a:0 "Oh, my God."
 britain.9.t:0 "Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin's resignation"
 britain.9.d:0 "Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin resigned as prime minister, announcing his retirement from politics, citing his age. Neville Chamberlain has been named to succeed him, and the British Parliament will now be run by the Neville Chamberlain cabinet."
 britain.9.a:0 "How will the new government lead the UK"
 britain.10.t:0 "Backlash Against the Election"
 britain.10.d:0 "Left-wing and centrist parties have protested that the recent election results were manipulated by the integralists. They are clashing with the integralists and seem to feel greatly threatened now that the integralists have seized power."
 britain.10.a:0 "Tell them to stop spouting nonsense"
 britain.11.t:0 "Backlash Against the Election"
 britain.11.d:0 "The integralists are strongly opposing the unexpected victory of the Conservative Party. This has thrown the British government into turmoil, and it seems very difficult to overcome."
 britain.11.a:0 "Brace for Impact."
 britain.12.t:0 "Integralists backlash"
 britain.12.d:0 "British Union of Integralists is strongly opposed to the outcome of this general election. They claim the election was rigged by the communists. Whatever the facts, the government is now in the hands of the communists."
 britain.12.a:0 "Tell them not to talk nonsense"
 britain.13.t:0 "The Big Ben Arson Incident"
 britain.13.d:0 "Last night, Big Ben — a symbol of Britain — was set ablaze in a shocking incident. Police have revealed that the arsonist was a member of the Labour Party, claiming it was an act of protest against the current government. The event has sent shockwaves across the nation and raised concerns that opposition forces against the Conservative government are becoming increasingly radical. The press has labeled it an act of political terrorism, and the government has announced it will use all available means to track down those responsible."
 britain.13.a:0 "It's time to act"
 britain.14.t:0 "Left-Wing Parties Outlawed"
 britain.14.d:0 "Today, following the recent Big Ben arson incident, the government has officially outlawed the Labour Party and all other left-wing political factions. These parties strongly condemned the move as political repression, but with the integralist victory now firmly secured, resistance seems futile. Labour Party offices across the country are being shut down, and key figures are either being arrested or fleeing. While some citizens expressed concern, the media hailed the move as a 'legitimate step for national security.' The government has also announced plans to increase surveillance on left-leaning civic groups and media outlets. A historic turning point in British politics has arrived."
 britain.14.a:0 "They are finished"
 britain.15.t:0 "Cruiser tank and Infantry tank"
 britain.15.d:0 "There was a debate over whether the Army Command would develop a thick armored tank to support infantry or a fast-paced tank to break through the enemy lines. Our choice is..."
 britain.15.a:0 "Infantry tank"
 britain.15.b:0 "Cruiser tank"
 britain.16.t:0 "The Fate of the British royal family"
 britain.16.d:0 "The existence of the royal family is out of step with the socialist regime. The royal family should be abolished and the property confiscated by the government."
 britain.16.a:0 "Execute them and confiscate their property."
 britain.16.b:0 "Expel them and confiscate their property"
 britain.17.t:0 "Exile of the British royal family"

 britain.21.t:0 "Combined training with the [SOV.GetName]"
 britain.21.d:0 "The [SOV.GetName] accepted our proposal, and the British and Soviet forces finished their joint exercises without much trouble. This exercise led to the improvement of the quality of British and Soviet troops."
 britain.21.a:0 "Great"
 britain.22.t:0 "The [SOV.GetName] rejects our proposal for Combined training"
 britain.22.d:0 "Our proposal for joint training was ultimately rejected. They still seemed to be wary of us and cooperation with them may be difficult for some time to come."

 britain.25.a:0 "I can't understand."
 britain.26.t:0 "[SOV.GetName] Agreed to Military Cooperation"
 britain.26.d:0 "The [SOV.GetName] agreed on military cooperation with us. They and we will start our military exchanges."

 britain.28.d:0 "The [SOV.GetName] agreed on scientific cooperation with us. They and we will start our scientific exchanges."

 britain.35.d:0 "The French government did not approach our proposal and in the end military cooperation with them went to nothing."
 britain.35.a:0 "We'll go our own way. You idiots"
 britain.36.t:0 "The civil war against the Integralists"
 britain.36.d:0 "Eventually, what we were concerned about happened in England. The British Union of Integralists, led by Oswald Moseley, launched a civil war in southwestern England, denying the current British government. The UK is in turmoil."

 britain.40.a:0 "We have high expectations for him."
 britain.41.t:0 "The Second Great War"
 britain.41.d:0 "A war broke out between France and Germany. Another war that will shake the world is perhaps a great opportunity for Britain. It is certain that if we help France win the war, we can regain the glory of the past. On the contrary, if we just sit on the sidelines of the situation on the continent, we'll see the German Empire expand its influence to a great extent and put pressure on us."
 britain.41.a:0 "Opportunity seldom knocks twice."
 britain.41.b:0 "It is too dangerous."
 britain.42.t:0 "Prepare for the Return of the King."

 britain.43.t:0 "Parliament Crisis"
 britain.43.d:0 "The people's continued support for the king and distrust of Parliament eventually led to a major crisis for the British Parliament.

 britain.44.t:0 "General Resignation of the Cabinet"
 britain.44.d:0 "At the end of the day, the British cabinet decided to resign as a whole due to constant pressure and demands from the people. With the resignation of the cabinet, an emergency cabinet was launched, and the British political situation was thrown into great turmoil. It is clear that the election of a new leader to lead Britain will take place soon. And the majority of the people are now looking to have the king as their leader, and that public opinion is overwhelmingly investigated in Britain."

 britain.45.t:0 "Demand of Britain"

 britain.45.b:0 "An impossible remark."
 britain.46.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] gave in to us"
 britain.46.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] eventually accepted our annextion demanding, and their territory is now ours. Everything produced there and its population was subordinate to the British. The glory of the British Empire is starting to shine once again."
 britain.46.a:0 "Great."
 britain.47.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] rejected our demand"
 britain.47.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] eventually rejected our demand. They have argued that they have no intention of relinquishing their autonomy, and that they would rather go to war. We'll smash them to the ground as they want."
 britain.47.a:0 "Crush them thoroughly."
 britain.48.t:0 "Alliance with Britain"
 britain.48.d:0 "The British government expressed its desire to form an alliance with us. They approached us asking for some of the colonies that we had. So maybe an alliance between these two is necessary to counter France."
 britain.48.a:0 "That's a good idea."
 britain.48.b:0 "I wonder if it's necessary."
 britain.50.t:0 "German British Alliance"
 britain.50.d:0 "Yesterday evening, the alliance between the German Empire and Britain was officially declared. The two countries announced that they would share each other's fate as a community of fate, and that they would never abandon either side. France react very sensitive to the union of these two powers and this alliance is likely to change the map of Europe in the future."
 britain.50.a:0 "What will Europe face in the future?"
 britain.51.t:0 "German rejection about the alliance"
 britain.51.d:0 "The German government rejected the proposal to form an alliance with us. They seem to believe that they can do well on their own. Their arrogance will bring them down."

 britain.61.a:0 "The results will tell."
 britain.62.t:0 "Scottish Independence"
 britain.62.d:0 "Scotland took advantage of the post-war turmoil to declare independence. The ongoing movement of Scottish independence in Britain eventually exploded in the wake of the war. Neglecting this could jeopardize Britain's existence."
 britain.62.a:0 "Oh, God..."
 britain.63.t:0 "Discussion of Scottish independence recognition"
 britain.63.d:0 "Discussions continued in the British government about whether to recognize Scotland's independence or to bring them to submission even by force. If the war is carried out again while the long war has barely ended, public sentiment may worsen, and if Scotland's independence is left intact, Britain's existence may be jeopardized."
 britain.63.a:0 "Declare war."
 britain.63.b:0 "There's no way."
 britain.64.t:0 "Scottish Declaration of Independence"
 britain.64.d:0 "Yesterday morning, amazing news spread throughout the world from the United Kingdom. After a peace treaty was signed between the United Kingdom and Germany, Scotland declared independence from the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter the actual defeat of the U.K., social chaos within the country reached its peak, and it seems that Scottish separatists took advantage of this to rise up in an uprising. Now, the world is paying attention to the U.K.'s response to Scottish independence."
 britain.64.a:0 "It's a surprise."
 britain.66.t:0 "Discord with France"
 britain.66.d:0 "With Germany defeated and the war in Europe over, fissures among the victors have quickly emerged. During the war, a common enemy bound us together, but with that threat gone, the differences between France and Britain have come to the forefront. The French government now seeks to cement its absolute leadership, increasingly dismissing our concerns and proposals. What began as an alliance under the banner of unity has devolved into France’s hegemonic project—one Britain cannot accept. Our government has resolved not to remain under Paris’s shadow any longer. Britain will chart its own course and withdraw from the French-led faction. History will mark this day as the moment of our separation."
 britain.66.a:0 "We will not remain under France’s shadow."
 britain.67.t:0 "Britain’s Proposal of Cooperation"
 britain.67.d:0 "The British government has formally proposed transatlantic cooperation. With France tightening its grip over the continent, Britain has realized it cannot stand alone and seeks to shape a new order alongside us. Accepting the proposal would strengthen our ties with Britain and give us a leading role in shaping the postwar order. Yet doing so may strain relations with France and burden us with far greater responsibility in European affairs."
 britain.67.a:0 "Accept the proposal — together we will shape the future."
 britain.67.b:0 "Reject the proposal — we will walk our own path."
 britain.68.t:0 "The United States Accepts"
 britain.68.d:0 "The American government has accepted our proposal of cooperation. This is not a mere diplomatic gesture but a clear declaration of intent to jointly shape and lead the postwar order. Washington and London are now united under common goals, offering a counterbalance to France’s unilateral ambitions. The spirit of transatlantic alliance has inspired our people with renewed hope, and Britain once more secures a prominent role in world affairs."
 britain.68.a:0 "The transatlantic alliance is born."
 britain.69.t:0 "The United States Refuses"
 britain.69.d:0 "The American government has rejected our proposal of cooperation. Declaring that they will walk their own path, the Americans have left Britain with deep disappointment. With France’s influence expanding across Europe, their refusal risks leaving us isolated diplomatically. Within the government, optimists argue that we can still forge our own way, while realists insist we must find new partners. What is certain, however, is that Britain must now proceed without the support of our transatlantic cousins."
 britain.69.a:0 "We shall carve our path alone."
