This event would quite literally pull the trigger on the century old System the of Balance of Power in Europe, setting of the Greatest War known to Man.\n The War play’s out like in our Timeline for about the first month until August 26,1914, three days after the Japanese entrance into the war. When the SMS Magdeburg closely avoids grounding on the small Island of Osmussaar. Due to this the German Codebooks on Board never fall into Russian hands and the German Radio Code isn’t broken.\n On October 19,1914 the Race to the Sea concludes, under heavy losses on all sides, in a stalemate with the Germans coming as far as Calais. Due to these losses both sides dug in and a trench warfare developed from the coast of the channel down to Switzerland.\n On November 1, 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered the war on Germany's side, but there was no significant change.\n Unlike on the land, Germany got the upper hand in the sea. The British couldn't get an intel advantage which would have allowed for a surprise attack on the German. Therefor on January 24,1915 the British were defeated by the German’s at Dogger Bank. As a result, German commander of the Hochseeflotte, Friedrich von Ingenohl could maintain his position and Unrestricted Submarine Warfare, wasn’t implemented until February 1916. He wanted to defeat British main fleet on several occasions resulting in May 1915 were the British Navy took sizeable losses during the first and second Battle of Jutland (Skagerrakschlacht).\n Because of these battles commander of Grand Fleet, John Jellicoe was dismissed, and David Beatty was designated as commander of Grand fleet.

But still, through counter attacks the fort of Verdun stood strong for 300 and 3 days, and eventually the German attack was called off. Due to the countless lives lost in this failed offensive Falkenhayn was dismissed by the Kaiser.\n On the Eastern front meanwhile, the Germans achieved decisive victory’s in the battle of Tannenberg on August 26, 1914, and fall of Warsaw on August 5. 1915. In these bad conditions, Russia began to strike back through the Brusiloy Offensive and drove the Austria-Hungarian Army to almost complete extinction. But Russia couldn't turn the tide in the end, because of the disastrous supply situation. Russian forces slowly started to retreated from Germany, which took the command over eastern front. Even Romania enter the Great War on the side of the Entente on August 27th 1916, but the defeats continued.\n Finally, in February of 1917 a Revolution broke out in the Russian Empire forcing the Tsar to abdicate.

On February 10th 1918. Germany resumed the offensive on Russia therefor forcing the new Soviet Russia to the negotiation table. In the end, on march 3rd 1918 Russia signed the treaty of Brest-Litovsk ending the eastern front. As Russia left the battle field, the Romanian government judged it was impossible to continue the war. So, Romania signed the peace Treaty of Bucharest in May 1918.\n Meanwhile on Western the situation had developed quite a bit. First Italy joined the Entente in the war opening a new front with Austria on May 23rd 1915. Second was the battle of the Somme were the British began a great offensive to take back Calais and distract German attention from Verdun. But every time they attacked, a German counterattack would follow resulting in many casualties. Especially after Hindenburg became chief of staff British losses mounted as Germany turned to defense strategy."
 update_event.4.d:0 " Over the cause of the battle, more than half a million soldiers had fallen on the Somme. In Total Britain only achieved to shift the front by 5 miles (8 Kilometers). Third Portugal entered the Great War in March 1916, by joining the British and declaring war to the Central Powers. Fourth was the Neville Offensive on April 16th 1917. Entente hoped that their offensive would turn the tide of the war but failed miserably due to the Germans intercepting the orders and reinforcing their defenses. This defeat led to insubordination and disturbance in the French army causing huge chaos. But this chaos ended after Petain or known as lion of Verdun became the chief of staff who established reforms in the army and Held up the of promise victory in the war. At last was the Battle of Caporetto from October 24th 1917 to November 12th on the Italian-Austrian front. In this battle, Italian troops suffered catastrophically casualties against German and Austrian troops breaking the front. Finally they were pushed to Adige shore.\n Also, two bid events happened on the Balkan fronts. It was entry into the war of Bulgaria and Greece. Bulgaria participated in the war on 14 October 1915 on the side of Central Powers against Serbia and Greece. Greek government argued over to support Central Powers or Entete Powers (National Schism) after the Great War broke out. In the end, June 27th 1917, Greece became a member of Entete Powers officially by atbdication of King Constantine I because of Entete's pressure.\n Under these circumstances, Germany could got food stably by taking Ukraine and reinforce western fronts by turning the troops of eastern fronts, May 10th 1918, Entete panned an offensive to breake the German line (Spring Offensive of 1918) before German eastern troops join the western fronts. And they started offensive to push back northern part of western fronts, Germany retreated from the fronts several miles by two times of wave offensives. But Entete couldn't make progress anymore because they reached to the culminating point. Also, as eastern fronts troops gradually reinforced to the western fronts during the offensive, Entete headquarter formed their opinion that proceeding this offensive is meaningless. So they turned their troops to defensive. Futhermore, commander Foch ordered to build heavily armed defense line (Foch line) along the newly expanded fronts to defense german offensive."
 update_event.5.d:0 " June 1st 1913, every german troops without Osteuropa defense forces gathered to the western fronts. June 7th 1918, Kaiserschlacht, known as Ludendorff Offensive started. New strategy based on Hutier tactics and reorganized German troops broke Entete's defense line in an instant. And Entete retreated to the Foch line. At the same time, France requested Italy to begin offensive against Austria so that they could disperse German troops. According to that request Veneto offensive started by Italian forces (July 19th 1918 ~ July 30th 1918).\n But Italy began to be ousted to Po river by counterattack of German-Austrio troops even France and Britain supported them because they couldn't recapture from untold losses on 11 times of Battles of the Isonzo and Battle of Caporetto. As time passing by, a collapse of Italian army and fall of Rome gradually came true and Italy escaped from the war by concluded a peace with Central Powers arbitrarily on August 4th 1918(Treaty of Trentino). During the Great war, Central Powers got military access to northern Italy by the treaty. The offensive to press Germany became the knife drew at southern France. Because of this new-made southern fronts, Entete forces should, split its troops and this made reduction of defensive power against German offensive. August 1Oth 1913, Foch line had broken. And on September 2nd 1918, Paris has fallen. The fatigue accumulated by the war that had lasted too long and the news of the ongoing defeat angered both the French military and the people, and many people, from the front of France to the cities in the rear, began to stir up unrest. The French government noticed that it is impassable to continue the war November 11th 1918 at 11o’clock, Germany and France signed on the peace agreement in Calais where was occupied by Germany. September 2nd 1919, the Treaty of Frankfurt, a peace treaty between France and Central Powers was signed. The day was Sedantag and it was deliberately decided by the German government to conclude the treaty on that day. Greece, which saw Paris collapse and Italy surrender, also surrendered to Central Powers and signed a peace treaty September 10th 1918 (The Treaty of Thessaloniki). Britain, the last major country of Entete which can confront Germany, waged war of nerves with Germany over the sea."
