 country_capitulated.1.d:0 "Paris has fallen into the hands of the Germans after a battle in recent days. The Germans marched past the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the citizens of Paris watched the scene with grief.\n\nThe French Army made some major strategic mistakes which led to the fall of Paris. However, despite the fall of the capital, the French are still burning up their fighting spirit, and the French government has made a position that surrender cannot exist and that it will definitely recapture Paris. Although the capital has been lost, the war is likely to continue."

Grenades and flamethrowers were reportedly needed to fight stubborn NKVD holdouts intent on defending every inch of the complex. The Russian capital is now in enemy's hands, but has been left a burning ruin. \n\nUnconfirmed reports indicate Lenin's embalmed corpse was safely evacuated east."
