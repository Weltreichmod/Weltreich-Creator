 CHI_expand_basic_education_text:0 "§YUniversal Education Guarantee Act§!(Amended)\nCompulsory education had previously been limited to the primary school level. This amendment seeks to extend the period of compulsory education to middle school, thereby expanding the right to education."
 CHI_modernize_education_system_text:0 "§YEducation Act§!\nChina's current education system lacks standardization, and outdated educational practices are still applied in many regions. This legislation seeks to codify the curriculum, unify it across all regions of the country, and promote the modernization of education."
 CHI_judicial_reform_text:0 "§YPublic Defender Act§!\nUnder the current judicial system, access to legal defense is often determined by an individual's economic means, leaving the rights of many citizens insufficiently protected. The Public Defender Act establishes a state-funded system of public defense, ensuring that all defendants, regardless of economic status, are guaranteed lawful representation and a fair trial.\n\n§YJudicial Election Act§!\nJudicial appointments have long been criticized for being influenced by administrative authority and political considerations. The Judicial Election Act introduces the direct election of judges by the people, with the aim of strengthening judicial accountability and institutionally preventing undue influence from the executive branch and local power structures."
 CHI_excessive_legislation_prevention_text:0 "§YExcessive Legislation Prevention Act§!\nThis bill restricts the scope and procedures under which the executive branch may submit legislation to the National Assembly. Its purpose is to institutionally prevent administrative power from excessively encroaching upon the legislative domain, thereby reaffirming the primacy of the National Assembly in lawmaking and ensuring that executive bill submissions occur only under clear requirements and accountability."
 CHI_attack_confucian_clanism_text:0 "§YPrivate Education Prohibition Act§!\nThis act prohibits educational activities not approved by the state and seeks to integrate all education into the public education system. Informal institutions such as traditional academies, sustained by local elites and networks of kinship, region, and affiliation, have reproduced specific values and outdated customs, structurally hindering the expansion of institutional education. By prohibiting these practices, the government aims to disseminate a new civic consciousness through liberal public education.\n\n§YRural Revitalization Act§!\nBy comprehensively expanding educational, administrative, and living infrastructure and deploying a new generation educated under liberal principles into rural communities, this act seeks to alleviate the structural rigidity of local society. It is understood as a means of integrating rural areas into a liberal social order through the reorganization of institutions and everyday life."
 CHI_national_heritage_reorganization_movement_text:0 "§YPrivate Education Prohibition Act§!\nThis act prohibits educational activities not approved by the state and seeks to integrate all education into the public education system.

By prohibiting these practices, the government aims to disseminate a new civic consciousness through liberal public education."
 CHI_share_wealth_with_all_text:0 "§YUniversal Wealth Sharing Act§!\nA welfare bill aimed at distributing fiscal resources and social achievements accumulated by the state broadly across the population rather than concentrating them within a limited group. By reorganizing fiscal and social institutions, it secures basic living stability and expands public welfare systems, allowing all citizens of the Republic to directly benefit from national development.\nThese measures reduce economic disparities between social strata, stabilize living conditions nationwide, and strengthen social integration through institutional means."
