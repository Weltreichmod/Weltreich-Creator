 italy.5.b:0 "Then we do not need to proceed with this meeting either."
 italy.6.t:0 "Our request was rejected again"
 italy.6.d:0 "All our demands have been ignored by them. There seems to be no reason to continue this negotiation."
 italy.6.a:0 "It's meaningless."
 italy.7.t:0 "Austria agrees to return Lombardy-Venezia territory!"
 italy.7.d:0 "Austria has agreed to return the Lombardy-Venezia territories to us. The vast territories we have lost will come back into our hands."
 italy.7.a:0 "Great!"
 italy.8.t:0 "Germany hopes to help them"
 italy.8.d:0 "The Germans are asking us to join Reichspakt. What should we do?"

 italy.9.t:0 "A proposal of Germany"
 italy.9.d:0 "Germany wants us to participate in the event that they go to war with Austria. No one knows whether accepting this will benefit or harm the herd."

 italy.9.b:0 "Well... No."
 italy.10.t:0 "The outbreak of the Italian Civil War"
 italy.10.d:0 "Italy was plunged into a civil war, starting with a shooting between government troops and Black Shirts in Rome. This civil war between fascists and republicans made Italy a divided country once again."

 italy.10.b:0 "Let's bring down the government!"
 italy.11.t:0 "A proposal of France"
 italy.11.d:0 "The French government says it wants us to join their faction. This alliance might benefit us a lot."

 italy.11.b:0 "We have other plans for them."
 italy.16.t:0 "Paris-Roma Institute of Research"
 italy.16.d:0 "The French government suggested that we create a joint research institute. If we accept this, we will have good results in improving our relationship with France and in our technical research."
 italy.16.a:0 "Good idea."
 italy.16.b:0 "We don't need it."
 italy.17.t:0 "Suspicious Movement of Fascists"
 italy.17.d:0 "Recently, a suspicious move by Mussolini and his fascist supporters has been spotted. According to intelligence, they are trying to enter the capital by train. It seems necessary to strengthen Roman defenses and inspect trains."
 italy.17.a:0 "There's no harm in being careful..."
 italy.17.b:0 "If you're gonna say something weird like that, get out of here."
 italy.18.t:0 "Successfully Finished Rome Party Convention"
 italy.18.d:0 "Yesterday evening's Rome Party Convention of the Partito Fascista Repubblicano ended without much trouble. Despite rumors that there would be an assassination attempt against the prime minister, the prime minister pushed ahead with the party convention, which ended without much incident thanks to increased security in Rome. It seems that Gentile's power will remain firmly in place."
 italy.18.a:0 "Long live Italy!"
 italy.19.t:0 "Assassination of Prime Minister Gentile!"
 italy.19.d:0 "Yesterday evening we had some very shocking news from Rome. During Partito Fascista Repubblicano's Party Convention, a bomb exploded with a loud explosion, and Italian Prime Minister Gentile died instantly on the spot. Authorities believe it was a systematic crime against radical communists and major disruptions are expected in Italy."
 italy.19.a:0 "Impossible!"
 italy.20.t:0 "LDP's Victory"
 italy.20.d:0 "The winner of this general election was the LDP. The LDP has maintained a high approval rating since its establishment in 1921, and there has been no surprise in this general election."
 italy.20.a:0 "Nitti will continue to serve as prime minister."
 italy.21.t:0 "Postponement of the General Election"
 italy.21.d:0 "Due to the Italian civil war, the general election will be postponed. I don't know how long the civil war will last, but a general election seems impossible, at least in the midst of the civil war."
 italy.21.a:0 "Well... I see."
 italy.22.t:0 "Treaty of Rome"
 italy.22.d:0 "Diplomats in our country had discussions with Italian diplomats about the division of Somalia. The Ogaden area that Somalia occupies was originally our territory and Italy said they would return it to us if they attacked the rear when they invaded Somalia."
 italy.22.a:0 "What a great opportunity."
 italy.23.t:0 "Ethiopia Agrees"
 italy.23.d:0 "The Ethiopian government has promised to attack the rear if we invade Somalia. We're going to enter Africa again."

 italy.24.t:0 "Italy's call for war"
 italy.24.d:0 "Under the Treaty of Rome, our country is obliged to participate in the Italian-Somalia War."
 italy.24.a:0 "Charge!"
 italy.25.t:0 "Italy–Somalia War"
 italy.25.d:0 "Last night Italian troops made a surprise landing in Somalia and launched an invasion. Somalia used to be an Italian colony, but as a result of World War I it lost its colony. However, Somalia is likely to fall under Italian control again. Experts predict that a few weeks will be enough to Italy to topple the government because it is Somal."
 italy.25.a:0 "Italy is expanding."
 italy.26.t:0 "Ethiopia's intervention"
 italy.26.d:0 "While Italy and Somalia are at war, Ethiopia has launched an invasion of Somalia. It is safe to say that Somalia is no longer likely to survive. The Ethiopian and Italian governments appear to have a secret pact over Somalia, with the two countries likely to take Somalia in two after the war."
 italy.26.a:0 "Somalia is over."
 italy.27.t:0 "The end of Italy–Somalia War"
 italy.27.d:0 "Eventually, Somalia was taken over by Italy and Ethiopia. Somalia's independence seems very difficult."
 italy.27.a:0 "Be as expected."
 italy.28.t:0 "The end of Italy–Somalia War"
 italy.28.d:0 "In the end, Somalia was defeated by Italian and Ethiopian troops. Italy and Ethiopia divided the territory of Somalia and independence of Somalia seems impossible. The war has completely wiped Somalia off the map and may be the starting point for Italy's expansionist moves."
 italy.28.a:0 "It was a short independence of twenty odd years."
 italy.29.t:0 "Second Italo-Turkish War"
 italy.29.d:0 "You have the Italian invasion of Libya declaring war on the Ottomans, in the midst of great turmoil due to the independence of the Ottoman minority. As Italy did in 1911, it seems to be trying to take Libya back from the Ottoman Empire. It remains to be seen whether Italy will be able to beat the Ottomans again this time. However, it is as clear that Italy's current moves, including the invasion of Somalia, are upsetting Germany and the Austria-Hungary Empire."
 italy.29.a:0 "I see."
 italy.30.t:0 "Ottoman Offered Surrender Terms"
 italy.30.d:0 "The Ottomans couldn't hold out our military fighters and they offered surrender terms. Italy wins and Libya will be our land again."
 italy.30.a:0 "Good."
 italy.30.b:0 "We are going the distance."
 italy.31.t:0 "The end of Second Italo-Turkish War"
 italy.31.d:0 "The Italian invasion of the Ottoman Empire, which was in great turmoil, eventually led to the Italian victory. The whole of Libya is now in Italy's hands, and it's clear that the fall of the Ottoman Empire is accelerating."
 italy.31.a:0 "The sick man of europe is dying."
 italy.32.t:0 "The end of Second Italo-Turkish War"
 italy.32.d:0 "The Italian military has been considered to be inferior in quality, but now the level of Italian troops, which is in turmoil, seems to have fallen to a poor degree. The recent war between Italy and the Ottoman eventually resulted in the withdrawal of the Italian forces, which effectively led to the Ottoman Empire's victory. The Italian army is said to have been unable to properly push the Ottoman Empire's Army throughout the entire war."
 italy.32.a:0 "The Italian army is so inferior."
 italy.33.t:0 "France's rejection"
 italy.33.d:0 "The French government rejected our proposal after much consideration. I don't know exactly why, but at least I'm sure that France doesn't want to join us."
 italy.33.a:0 "But, Why?"
 italy.34.t:0 "Germany's rejection"
 italy.34.d:0 "The German government rejected our proposal after much consideration. I don't know exactly why, but at least I'm sure that Germany doesn't want to join us."
 italy.34.a:0 "But, Why?"
 italy.35.t:0 "Mussolini's Coup attempt"
 italy.35.d:0 "This morning Mussolini and his group of men marched into Rome and attempted to take control of the government. But it's said that the government figured this out in advance, blocked Rome, arrested a large number of Mussolini's gang, and Mussolini eventually failed the coup and fled to Switzerland.\n\nTheir uprising seems to be very unpremeditated, and this failure will adversely affect the expansion of the fascists. Italy's democracy will continue."
 italy.35.a:0 "It's defeat of fascist."
 italy.36.t:0 "Assassination of Prime Minister Gentile!"
 italy.36.d:0 "Gentile, Italy's prime minister, was assassinated at the Italian Party Convention in Rome yesterday evening. Dubbed the father of Italian fascism, he was killed on the spot in a bombing terror while speaking on the podium, and senior party officials nearby are said to have suffered serious injuries.\n\nThe Italian authorities believe that the communists are responsible, and the disappearance of the center of Italian fascism may bring about a major change in Italian politics."
 italy.36.a:0 "What will happen to Italy?"
 italy.37.t:0 "Italy's crushing defeat"
 italy.37.d:0 "Italy lost to Ethiopia again this time, as it did in the past. Despite the surprise attack on an African country, they failed to push well and were defeated. It's obvious what happens when Italy goes to war with other countries in the future."
 italy.37.a:0 "Is that Europe?"
 italy.39.t:0 "Italian Civilwar"
 italy.39.d:0 "Starting with the sound of gunfire in downtown Rome, the whole of Italy was engulfed in civil war. Italy was divided into the southern part of the fascist forces and the northern part of the republic. This seems to be the result of a combination of various types of conflicts, including conflicts with the North and South and ideological conflicts that have continued inside Italy. Everyone is paying attention to who will win at the end of the civil war and what the future of Italy will be."
 italy.39.a:0 "Who will be the second Garabaldi?"
 italy.40.t:0 "Discussion of a cease-fire"
 italy.40.d:0 "As the Italian Civil War continues, the country becomes very impoverished. Both the Republicans and the Fascists were tired of the prolonged civil war, and internal talk of a ceasefire continued. Eventually, the government also officially talked about a ceasefire. We must decide about a cease-fire agreement."
 italy.40.a:0 "Let's propose an armistice"
 italy.40.b:0 "No coexistence with fascists!"
 italy.41.t:0 "An offer of a truce of Republicans"
 italy.41.d:0 "After a long line of solidification, the Republicans offered a truce. Both we and they are very tired of the long civil war, and a ceasefire may be a good opportunity in this situation."
 italy.41.a:0 "Okay. Fine."
 italy.41.b:0 "Full of baloney."
 italy.42.t:0 "Italian Armistice Agreement"
 italy.42.d:0 "After a long civil war, the two Italys decided to sign a truce with each other. A long civil war has left the two countries in deep tiredness, which had led to strong support for the ceasefire agreement. An indefinite cease-fire has been signed between Republicans and fascists, but we don't know how long this agreement will last. Maybe the two countries will be divided forever, or they will be engulfed in civil war again. But for now, peace has come for a while."
 italy.42.a:0 "Peace for a while"
 italy.43.t:0 "Fascists Rejected"
 italy.43.d:0 "The Fascists rejected our proposal for an armistice. They made it clear that they couldn't live in the same house with us. The war will continue."
 italt.43.a:0 "The same goes for us, you son of a gun."
 italy.45.t:0 "Italy Reunited"
 italy.45.d:0 "After a series of Italian civil wars, Italy is eventually united again. Sporadic skirmishes are still going on here and there, but they are expected to be contained within a few days. As a result of a long civil war, Italy has been destroyed, and infrastructure is not functioning again. It will take a very long time to recover from this damage."
 italy.45.a:0 "A New Era in Italy"
 italy.46.t:0 "France's infantry equipment sales proposal"
 italy.46.d:0 "France offered us the sale of infantry equipment. If we accept this, we'll get 1,000 infantry equipments."
 italy.46.a:0 "Good"
 italy.46.b:0 "No"
 italy.47.t:0 "Purchase of infantry equipment in Italy"
 italy.47.d:0 "Italy agreed to buy weapons from us, and now we're going to get paid for it."
 italy.47.a:0 "Let's get it"
 italy.48.t:0 "Italy Rejects Our Offer"
 italy.48.d:0 "Italy didn't want to buy weapons from us. We and their attempt at a deal has been nullified."
 italy.48.a:0 "Well, Whatever."
 italy.49.t:0 "The end of Second Italo-Ethiopian War"
 italy.49.d:0 "After a long battle, Italy won the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. And that allowed Italy to wash away the disgrace of 1896. But despite Italy's eventual victory, Italy's various battles in the war weren't very good, which is why there are still questions about whether the Italian forces are the weakest. Italy, which won the war anyway, said it was enjoying its victory and planning to reconstruct Ethiopia."
 italy.49.a:0 "Anyway, they won."
 italy.38.t:0 "The end of Ottoman Empire"
 italy.38.d:0 "After constant Italian aggression, the Ottoman Empire eventually collapsed. Despite the Ottoman request for conditional surrender, Italy refused, and after declaring that the war would continue until the Ottoman Empire collapsed completely, Italy eventually succeeded in toppling the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman's will be territorially adjusted to what Italy wants, and they will have to pay back huge war reparations."
 italy.38.a:0 "The sick man of Europe died."
 italy.50.t:0 "Large-scale Industrial Withdrawal in Lombardy–Venetia"
 italy.50.d:0 "Lombardy–Venetia province's economy has been maintained by large Austrian companies. But now the region is under Italian control and a massive outflow of Austrian businesses and capitalists. This has left much of the province's industrial complex unable to recover, and it is likely that Lombardy–Venetia will need a considerable amount of time before it can again enjoy the same glory as it did in the past."
 italy.50.a:0 "We will restore it again."
 italy.51.t:0 "Overthrowing Government of the Democrats"
 italy.51.d:0 "Around lunch today, protesters led by democrats took control of the Italian parliament by force and succeeded in declaring the dissolution of the government.\n\nStill, many fascist members in Italy are resisting, but it is small and sporadic and likely to be easily suppressed. Democracy in Italy is back on."
 italy.51.a:0 "Revival of Italian Democracy"
 italy.52.t:0 "Remove the Threat of Antifascists."
 italy.52.d:0 "The Italian government successfully subdued the democrats and communists who opposed the fascists. From their threats Italy is safe, and so is its fascism.\n\nIn a week's time, the Grand Council of Fascism will elect a new Italian prime minister, which in turn will help stabilize the country."
 italy.52.a:0 "Italy never dies."
 italy.53.t:0 "Balbo elected as prime minister"
 italy.53.d:0 "Balbo was appointed as Italy's new prime minister following the Grand Council of Fascism vote in the wake of the departure of the Fascism leader who had previously planned the Roman march with Mussolini. This would mark a new era for Italy."
 italy.53.a:0 "Long live Balbo! Long live Italy!"
