 guide: "On June 28, 1914, two shots in Sarajevo shook the world. The ensuing July Crisis culminated in a general European war, drawing the Great Powers into a whirlwind of mobilization and diplomatic breakdown. In this mod’s divergence, our point of departure is August 25, 1914. The armored cruisers SMS Augusta and SMS Magdeburg—tasked with destroying the Russian Empire’s armored-cruiser squadron—completed their mission successfully without running aground, and Germany’s cipher books were never captured. As a result, Room 40 struggled to decrypt German communications for the duration of the war. The “Race to the Sea,” which began on October 19, 1914, ended in a decisive German victory: British and Belgian forces suffered catastrophic losses, Calais was ceded to Germany, and the devastating blow dealt to Britain’s elite formations meant that the qualitative edge of the British Expeditionary Force was never recovered. Nevertheless, the German advance stalled before the northern French port of Bergues, and both sides became mired in trench warfare. Additionally, on November 1, 1914, the Ottoman Empire’s entry into the war was officially confirmed, though of course it did not materially alter the strategic stalemate.\n\nWhile the land war was locked in a stalemate, naval warfare tilted in Germany’s favor. Because the Magdeburg did not run aground, the repercussions carried over into the Battle of Dogger Bank, where the British Navy—deprived of intelligence superiority—fell victim to a German naval ambush. On January 24, 1915, that engagement ended in a British defeat. As a result, Admiral Inglefield retained his post as commander of the Grand Fleet. He sought several times to crush the British Home Fleet outright, and in May 1915 engaged in two battles of Jutland. In each engagement, the Royal Navy was defeated in detail and suffered significant losses at the hands of the Imperial German Navy. Ultimately, these defeats led to the dismissal of Grand Fleet commander Sir John Jellicoe and the appointment of Admiral David Beatty."
 guide_1: "Beatty, determined to restore Britain’s maritime deterrent against Germany after three consecutive defeats, began operating the fleet more aggressively. He lured the German fleet toward the Heligoland Bight, leading to the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on December 14, 1915. Although Beatty initially appeared to overwhelm the German fleet with flexible tactics, a few tactical miscalculations turned the tide: the Grand Fleet was soundly defeated and forced to withdraw. This crushing loss cost Beatty his command as well, and Admiral Charles Madden succeeded him. Under Madden’s more cautious leadership, the German logistical situation gradually improved—far more than in actual history—making the Empire even stronger.\n\nDespite Germany’s considerable success at sea, fighting on the Western Front remained deadlocked. After the setback at the Marne on September 12, 1914, Field Marshal Moltke was replaced by Chief of the General Staff Falkenhayn, who on February 21, 1916, launched the Battle of Verdun to inflict massive casualties on France. Thanks to Germany’s improved supply situation, France suffered greater losses than in actual history but managed to hold its defenses. Ultimately, Falkenhayn was relieved by the Kaiser. Conversely, on the Eastern Front Germany had scored a victory at Tannenberg on August 26, 1914, and captured Warsaw on August 5, 1915, among other successes. Faced with these adverse conditions, on June 4, 1916, Russia launched the Brusilov Offensive—a desperate strike that nearly broke the Austro-Hungarian Army. However, ammunition shortages and appalling logistics prevented Russia from capitalizing, and German forces gradually seized command on the Eastern Front."
 guide_2: "Although Romania joined the Entente on August 27, 1916, its entry did not reverse the tide. Amid continuing Russian defeats, the February Revolution broke out on March 8, 1917, and the subsequent Kerensky Offensive (July 1–19, 1917) collapsed entirely. On November 7, 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution occurred. Germany resumed its offensive against Russia on February 10, 1918, forcing Soviet Russia to the negotiating table, and on March 3, 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed, formally removing Russia from the Great War. With Russia gone, Romania likewise made peace with the Central Powers on May 7, 1918 (Treaty of Bucharest). Russia’s exit from the war led to several changes on the Western Front.\n\nFirst, Italy’s entry into the war: on May 23, 1915, Italy joined the Entente and declared war on Austria, opening the Italian–Austro-Hungarian front. Second, the Battle of the Somme: from July 1 to November 18, 1916, British forces launched a major offensive to recapture Calais and relieve pressure on Verdun. Yet every attack ended in horrific casualties, and after Hindenburg became Chief of the General Staff, German forces adopted a more defensive posture, inflicting even greater losses. Over 500,000 British casualties were incurred for a gain of only five miles by the end of the battle. Third, Portugal entered the war: on March 9, 1916, the Portuguese First Republic acceded to Britain’s call to arms and declared war on the Central Powers. Fourth, the Nivelle Offensive (April 16, 1917) was launched by the Entente in hopes of breaking the stalemate, but because Germany had advance knowledge of the plans, the attack ended in a bloody repulse and even saw key strongpoints lost to German counterattacks. This disaster precipitated mutinies and uprisings within the Entente, plunging the French Army into chaos. However, calm was restored when Philippe Pétain, the “Lion of Verdun,” took command of the French forces."
 guide_3: "Finally, on October 24 to November 12, 1917, the Battle of Caporetto on the Italian–Austro-Hungarian front ended in a devastating defeat for Italy, which was pushed back to the Adige River. Though these battles exacted horrendous casualties, they produced little territorial change, and despite Germany’s local advantages, the strategic situation remained largely unaffected.\n\nWhile events on the Western Front unfolded, the Balkan theatre saw two major shifts: Bulgaria’s entry on October 14, 1915, siding with the Central Powers against Serbia and Greece, and Greece’s entry on June 27, 1917, after King Constantine I—who had favored the Central Powers—was forced to abdicate under Entente pressure. With Greece officially in the Entente, the situation stabilized in the Balkans.\n\nIn such circumstances, Germany secured the granary of Ukraine and concluded operations on the Eastern Front, ensuring stable food supplies and freeing troops to reinforce the Western Front against France. On March 10, 1918, the Entente planned a spring offensive to break before German reinforcements arrived, and from March 21 launched the 1918 Spring Offensive aiming to breach German defenses in the north. By June 5, 1918, two waves of attacks forced the Germans back several to a dozen miles. Overextended, the Entente offensive stalled short of its objectives, and as German troops from the East joined their Western counterparts, the Entente command deemed further attacks futile and switched to the defensive. Foch ordered the construction of a heavily fortified rear line—the Hindenburg Line—to guard against German attacks. By June 1, 1918, all but the Eastern Defense Army were concentrated on the Western Front."
 guide_4: "Then on June 7, 1918, the Kaiser’s Battle—known as the Ludendorff Offensive—began. Using new “Hutier” tactics and reorganized forces, the Germans pierced the Entente lines and drove them back to the Hindenburg Line. Simultaneously, to relieve pressure, Germany requested that Italy attack Austria; thus, from July 19 to July 30, 1918, the Battle of Veneto was fought. Despite assistance from French and British forces, the Italian Army—already weakened by eleven battles including the Isonzo and Caporetto—was pushed back to the Po Valley. Facing collapse and the fall of Rome, Italy independently signed an armistice with the Central Powers on August 4, 1918 (Treaty of Trentino). Under its terms, the Central Powers gained military transit rights through northern Italy, turning Germany’s offensive into a threat against southern France. The Entente had to disperse forces to block this new front, weakening their defenses against Germany. On August 10, 1918, the Hindenburg Line was breached; on September 2, Paris fell. The war’s exhaustion and cascading defeats enraged French soldiers and civilians alike, triggering uprisings from the front lines to the cities in rear areas.\n\nJudging further resistance impossible, the French government signed an armistice at 11 a.m. on November 11, 1918, in Calais—now under German occupation. On September 2, 1919, the Frankfurt Treaty was concluded between France and the Entente; that date coincides with the Day of Sedan, deliberately chosen by the German government. Witnessing Italy’s capitulation and the fall of Paris, Greece too deemed further war futile and on December 10, 1918, surrendered to the Central Powers and concluded peace (Treaty of Thessaloniki). The last remaining Entente power facing Germany was Britain; separated by the sea, it engaged in tense negotiations with Germany. Although Germany had won several naval victories—partially breaking the blockade—it still lacked the strength to face the Grand Fleet head-on, and Britain, despite its maritime superiority, dared not attempt an invasion."
 guide_5: "To pressure Britain, Germany secretly supplied arms and military advisors to the IRA. On December 25, 1918, the so-called Christmas Uprising—the Irish War of Independence—broke out. Simultaneously, Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare to starve Britain into submission. Between January 17, 1919, and February 4, 1920, German U-boats sank 1,201,600 tons of shipping, imposing a heavy burden on Britain.\n\nSeeing further war as pointless, the British government proposed an armistice to Germany on February 19, 1920. Portugal, similarly constrained by German incursions into its waters and Britain’s capitulation, signed an armistice with Germany that same afternoon. Serbia, last holding out hope in Britain, surrendered to the Central Powers on February 22, 1920, when Britain capitulated. All European nations then ceased hostilities. Observing this, Japan concluded its own armistice with Germany and the Central Powers on May 5, 1920. Thus ended the Great War—with thirty million dead. On August 8, 1920, the Treaty of Leipzig was signed between the Central Powers and Portugal. On August 20, the Budapest Treaty was concluded, leading to Montenegro’s annexation by Austria-Hungary and making Serbia and Albania protectorates of Austria-Hungary. Finally, on November 11, 1920, the Copenhagen Treaty was signed between Britain and the Central Powers, and Japan—having no separate peace—simply withdrew from occupied territories, bringing the war to a definitive close."
