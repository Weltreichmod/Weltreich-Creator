 GER_country_intro_header: "Uncertainty Beneath the Euphoria – German Empire"
 GER_country_intro_content: "Having emerged victorious from the Great War, the German Empire stood tall in global prestige, unlike France, which was burdened by massive reparations. Yet beneath this triumph, the foundations of the Reich were slowly eroding. The military dictatorship that dominated the final stages of the war was temporarily dismantled through constitutional reforms, but the legacy of the Ludendorff regime still ran deep within the officer corps. After the war, the German economy had grown rapidly, but by the late 1920s it began to falter. In 1931, the American Great Depression spread to Europe, and Germany was soon engulfed in unemployment and financial instability.\n\nChancellor Wilhelm Marx sought to push forward civilian-led military reform and fiscal stabilization, but the Imperial High Command perceived these efforts as a threat and began plotting a silent counteroffensive. Within the Reichstag, the balance between major parties—Centre, Social Democrats, and Free Conservatives—has collapsed, and parliamentary chaos now reigns. There is no longer a stable majority, and even the Kaiser finds his authority eroded. Twenty years after victory, Germany once again stands at a crossroads. Who will become the next Chancellor—and who will guide the Reich, now encircled by uncertainty and enemies alike?"
 FRA_country_intro_header: "Under the Shadow of Defeat – French State"
 FRA_country_intro_content: "Since the disastrous defeat marked by the Treaty of Frankfurt, France has endured prolonged political turmoil and economic depression. Following General Pétain’s military coup in 1921, which led to the collapse of the Third Republic, various right-wing factions, centered around the Party of Republican Order, shared power. During this period, France gradually began to rebuild its economy and military. In 1934, the Stavisky affair triggered the downfall of the Pétain regime, and the former French People's Union led by Jacques Doriot seized control. The Doriot administration adopted mass socialism as its central ideology, establishing a system in which industry and labor were integrated and managed by the state. Notably, a deep-seated desire for revenge against Germany has become the driving force behind national unity.\n\nFrance now views colonial re-expansion, the reclamation of Nord-Pas-de-Calais, and retribution against Germany as its primary national objectives, and is reorganizing its diplomatic and military strategies accordingly. While the left has been forced underground due to political repression, it continues to exert influence. Meanwhile, opposition forces such as the Republican Order Party are also vying for dominance. Amidst this political instability, the question remains: can France truly achieve its goal of vengeance against Germany?"
 ENG_country_intro_header: "The Sun Sets on the Empire - United Kingdom"
 ENG_country_intro_content: "Neither victorious nor fully defeated, Britain emerged from the Weltkrieg in a state of unresolved confusion. Saddled with immense war debt and haunted by the trauma of countless veterans, the postwar period has brought economic stagnation and soaring unemployment. Although the Empire has retained most of its colonies, its grip is weakening — most notably in India, which now functions as a de facto independent state. The monarchy and government remain intact, but their authority is no longer unquestioned.\n\nAt home, political chaos reigns. Traditional parties have splintered, and Parliament has lost much of its effectiveness. On the streets, fascists and communists rally popular anger to expand their influence. Labor strikes and rural unrest threaten the social fabric. The upcoming general election will not merely determine the next government — it will decide the very future of the British nation and its system. Even the Royal Family watches with concern, preparing silently for the weighty decisions that may soon be required."
 USA_country_intro_header: "Awakening of the Giant - United States of America"
 USA_country_intro_content: "Seen as a symbol of liberty and prosperity, the United States remains one of the few great powers not to have participated directly in the Weltkrieg. Throughout the 1920s, rapid growth in consumption, technology, and popular culture made the so-called 'Roaring Twenties' a golden age that firmly established America's global prestige. However, the illusion was shattered in 1929 when the Great Depression struck, plunging the nation into a severe crisis. Industry came to a standstill, millions were left unemployed, and confidence in the free market system began to erode.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal offered a glimmer of hope amid the chaos, and while large-scale public works, social security programs, and financial reforms have helped stabilize society, critics argue that the underlying issues remain unresolved. Europe, torn between rivalries among Germany, France, and Britain, remains deeply unstable. Though the U.S. continues to uphold a policy of isolationism, worsening global tensions suggest that neutrality may not be sustainable forever. Can Roosevelt guide the nation through this storm and secure its future in a world on the brink?"
 SOV_country_intro_header: "Dawn of Communism - Soviet Russia"
 SOV_country_intro_content: "Following the collapse of the monarchy in the February Revolution of 1917, Russia briefly attempted a republican form of government under Kerensky and Axelrod. However, continued warfare and repression of the Soviets eroded public trust. Ultimately, a left-wing coalition led by Lenin, Spiridonova, and Trotsky launched the October Revolution, proclaiming 'All Power to the Soviets!' and founded a new political order under the Communist Party. Disputes over the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and Lenin's assassination led to Yakov Sverdlov's rise to leadership and the beginning of the Red Terror and mass purges.\n\nFollowing Sverdlov’s death, Kamenev became his successor, while Trotsky established the unified 'Red Force,' consolidating military power. Large-scale electrification, industrial development, and educational reforms were implemented, and the Comintern evolved into an international military body for global revolution. Yet internal and external conspiracies persisted, and with Kamenev falling into a coma after being shot in 1935, the leadership’s future became uncertain. Zinoviev, Stalin, Trotsky, Bukharin, and Tukhachevsky now compete for the helm of Soviet Russia."
 TUR_country_intro_header: "The Sick Man of Europe - The Ottoman Empire"
 TUR_country_intro_content: "Though the Ottoman Empire emerged as a victor alongside Germany in the Great War, it bore deep and lasting wounds. The suppression of the Arab Revolt and the repulsion of foreign threats did little to ease the immense postwar burden. The devastation of the war, the collapse of social infrastructure, soaring unemployment, and widespread discontent shook the Empire to its core. The regime of the Three Pashas, who had led the war effort, came to an end amidst public backlash, and in the ensuing elections, Mustafa Kemal rose to power, ushering in a new era of reform. Armed with strong military leadership and a vision for renewal, Kemal is striving to revive the empire.\n\nToday, Kemal pushes forward reforms across education, administration, and the military, aiming to fundamentally restructure the state. However, traditional tribal-based society and recurring nationalist uprisings continue to hinder these efforts. In regions such as Mesopotamia and parts of Anatolia, rebellions persist, requiring continued military response. While the Ottoman Empire may appear victorious on the surface, internally it remains unstable. True recovery will demand further sacrifice and unity among its people."
 AUH_country_intro_header: "The Legacy of the Habsburgs – The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy"
 AUH_country_intro_content: "Victory in the Great War narrowly prevented the collapse of the Habsburg Empire. Yet this was far from a complete triumph—if anything, the internal national question grew even more severe. Among the Czechs, South Slavs, and Romanians, calls for independence or autonomy intensified, and the Empire’s centripetal force steadily weakened. Despite standing among the victors, the people were outraged that their lives had not improved, and this discontent began manifesting in street demonstrations and the proliferation of underground movements.\n\nEmperor Karl I now understands that resolving these internal tensions is the only way to ensure the Empire’s survival. Before turning outward in pursuit of renewed prestige or expansion, it is imperative to stabilize public sentiment and reform the political framework from within. Proposals for constitutional revision, strengthened national autonomy, and restructuring of the Imperial Council are all under discussion. The Emperor is expected to make a decisive move in the near future. The Empire has not yet fallen—but its fate will hinge on what comes next."
 JAP_country_intro_header: "The Curse of the Rising Sun – The Empire of Japan"
 JAP_country_intro_content: "The Empire of Japan, having sided with the Entente during the Great War, found itself isolated and empty-handed when the conflict ended. While Germany consolidated its influence in East Asia by annexing Indochina, Japan lost its strategic initiative and now stands wary of the growing German presence. The Entente's defeat meant that Japan never recovered the payments for the vast amounts of armaments it supplied during the war. As a result, lacking any postwar economic windfall, the Japanese economy remained on the brink of collapse throughout the 1920s and 30s.\n\nDomestically, social unrest and political strife deepened with each passing year. In an attempt to reverse its fortunes, Japan turned its eyes toward Manchuria. However, local warlords—especially the Fengtian Clique—resisted Japanese encroachment, refusing to bend to foreign dominance. Though the empire yearns to reclaim its imperial ambitions, the international order is no longer willing to accommodate them. Now, Japan stands at a crossroads: will it forge a new path through the crumbling world order, or fade into obscurity? Its future remains uncertain."
 
 guide: "On June 28, 1914, two shots in Sarajevo shook the world. The ensuing July Crisis culminated in a general European war, drawing the Great Powers into a whirlwind of mobilization and diplomatic breakdown. In this mod’s divergence, our point of departure is August 25, 1914. The armored cruisers SMS Augusta and SMS Magdeburg—tasked with destroying the Russian Empire’s armored-cruiser squadron—completed their mission successfully without running aground, and Germany’s cipher books were never captured. As a result, Room 40 struggled to decrypt German communications for the duration of the war. The “Race to the Sea,” which began on October 19, 1914, ended in a decisive German victory: British and Belgian forces suffered catastrophic losses, Calais was ceded to Germany, and the devastating blow dealt to Britain’s elite formations meant that the qualitative edge of the British Expeditionary Force was never recovered. Nevertheless, the German advance stalled before the northern French port of Bergues, and both sides became mired in trench warfare. Additionally, on November 1, 1914, the Ottoman Empire’s entry into the war was officially confirmed, but it did not materially alter the strategic stalemate.\n\nWhile the land war was locked in a stalemate, naval warfare tilted in Germany’s favor. As the SMS Magdeburg was not stranded, the British failed to gain an intelligence advantage before the Battle of Dogger Bank, allowing the German navy to launch a surprise attack. As a result, the battle on January 24, 1915, ended in a British defeat. As a result, Admiral Inglefield retained his post as commander of the Grand Fleet. He sought several times to crush the British Home Fleet outright, and in May 1915 engaged in two battles of Jutland. In each engagement, the Royal Navy was defeated in detail and suffered significant losses at the hands of the Imperial German Navy. Ultimately, these defeats led to the dismissal of Grand Fleet commander Sir John Jellicoe and the appointment of Admiral David Beatty."
 guide_1: "Beatty, determined to restore Britain’s maritime deterrent against Germany after three consecutive defeats, began operating the fleet more aggressively. He lured the German fleet toward the Heligoland Bight, leading to the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on December 14, 1915. Although Beatty initially appeared to overwhelm the German fleet with flexible tactics, a few tactical miscalculations turned the tide: the Grand Fleet was soundly defeated and forced to withdraw. This crushing loss cost Beatty his command as well, and Admiral Charles Madden succeeded him. Due to the immense strategic and tactical damage, Admiral Charles Madden, newly appointed as commander, began to operate the fleet more cautiously. As a result, Germany’s supply difficulties gradually eased, ultimately making the Empire stronger than it had been in actual history.\n\nDespite Germany’s considerable success at sea, fighting on the Western Front remained deadlocked. After the setback at the Marne on September 12, 1914, Field Marshal Moltke was replaced by Chief of the General Staff Falkenhayn, who on February 21, 1916, launched the Battle of Verdun to inflict massive casualties on France. Thanks to Germany’s improved supply situation, France suffered greater losses than in actual history but managed to hold its defenses. Ultimately, Falkenhayn was relieved by the Kaiser. Conversely, on the Eastern Front Germany had scored a victory at Tannenberg on August 26, 1914, and captured Warsaw on August 5, 1915, among other successes. Faced with these adverse conditions, on June 4, 1916, Russia launched the Brusilov Offensive—a desperate strike that nearly broke the Austro-Hungarian Army. However, ammunition shortages and appalling logistics prevented Russia from capitalizing, and German forces gradually seized command on the Eastern Front."
 guide_2: "Although Romania joined the Entente on August 27, 1916, its entry did not reverse the tide. Amid continuing Russian defeats, the February Revolution broke out on March 8, 1917, and the subsequent Kerensky Offensive (July 1–19, 1917) collapsed entirely. On November 7, 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution occurred. Germany resumed its offensive against Russia on February 10, 1918, forcing Soviet Russia to the negotiating table, and on March 3, 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed, formally removing Russia from the Great War. With Russia gone, Romania likewise made peace with the Central Powers on May 7, 1918 (Treaty of Bucharest). Russia’s exit from the war led to several changes on the Western Front.\n\nFirst, Italy’s entry into the war: on May 23, 1915, Italy joined the Entente and declared war on Austria, opening the Italian–Austro-Hungarian front. Second, the Battle of the Somme: from July 1 to November 18, 1916, British forces launched a major offensive to recapture Calais and relieve pressure on Verdun. Yet every attack ended in horrific casualties, and after Hindenburg became Chief of the General Staff, German forces adopted a more defensive posture, inflicting even greater losses. Over 500,000 British casualties were incurred for a gain of only five miles by the end of the battle. Third, Portugal entered the war: on March 9, 1916, the Portuguese First Republic acceded to Britain’s call to arms and declared war on the Central Powers. Fourth, the Nivelle Offensive (April 16, 1917) was launched by the Entente in hopes of breaking the stalemate, but because Germany had advance knowledge of the plans, the attack ended in a bloody repulse and even saw key strongpoints lost to German counterattacks. This disaster precipitated mutinies and uprisings within the Entente, plunging the French Army into chaos. However, calm was restored when Philippe Pétain, the “Lion of Verdun,” took command of the French forces."
 guide_3: "Finally, on October 24 to November 12, 1917, the Battle of Caporetto on the Italian–Austro-Hungarian front ended in a devastating defeat for Italy, which was pushed back to the Adige River. Though these battles exacted horrendous casualties, they produced little territorial change, and despite Germany’s local advantages, the strategic situation remained largely unaffected.\n\nWhile events on the Western Front unfolded, the Balkan theatre saw two major shifts: Bulgaria’s entry on October 14, 1915, siding with the Central Powers against Serbia and Greece, and Greece’s entry on June 27, 1917, after King Constantine I—who had favored the Central Powers—was forced to abdicate under Entente pressure. With Greece officially in the Entente, the situation stabilized in the Balkans.\n\nIn such circumstances, Germany secured the granary of Ukraine and concluded operations on the Eastern Front, ensuring stable food supplies and freeing troops to reinforce the Western Front against France. On March 10, 1918, the Entente planned a spring offensive to break before German reinforcements arrived, and from March 21 launched the 1918 Spring Offensive aiming to breach German defenses in the north. By June 5, 1918, two waves of attacks forced the Germans back several to a dozen miles. Overextended, the Entente offensive stalled short of its objectives, and as German troops from the East joined their Western counterparts, the Entente command deemed further attacks futile and switched to the defensive. Foch ordered the construction of a heavily fortified rear line—the Hindenburg Line—to guard against German attacks. By June 1, 1918, all but the Eastern Defense Army were concentrated on the Western Front."
 guide_4: "Then on June 7, 1918, the Kaiser’s Battle—known as the Ludendorff Offensive—began. Using new “Hutier” tactics and reorganized forces, the Germans pierced the Entente lines and drove them back to the Hindenburg Line. Simultaneously, to relieve pressure, Germany requested that Italy attack Austria; thus, from July 19 to July 30, 1918, the Battle of Veneto was fought. Despite assistance from French and British forces, the Italian Army—already weakened by eleven battles including the Isonzo and Caporetto—was pushed back to the Po Valley. Facing collapse and the fall of Rome, Italy independently signed an armistice with the Central Powers on August 4, 1918 (Treaty of Trentino). Under its terms, the Central Powers gained military transit rights through northern Italy, turning Germany’s offensive into a threat against southern France. The Entente had to disperse forces to block this new front, weakening their defenses against Germany. On August 10, 1918, the Hindenburg Line was breached; on September 2, Paris fell. The war’s exhaustion and cascading defeats enraged French soldiers and civilians alike, triggering uprisings from the front lines to the cities in rear areas.\n\nJudging further resistance impossible, the French government signed an armistice at 11 a.m. on November 11, 1918, in Calais—now under German occupation. On September 2, 1919, the Frankfurt Treaty was concluded between France and the Entente; that date coincides with the Day of Sedan, deliberately chosen by the German government. Witnessing Italy’s capitulation and the fall of Paris, Greece too deemed further war futile and on December 10, 1918, surrendered to the Central Powers and concluded peace (Treaty of Thessaloniki). The last remaining Entente power facing Germany was Britain; separated by the sea, it engaged in tense negotiations with Germany. Although Germany had won several naval victories—partially breaking the blockade—it still lacked the strength to face the Grand Fleet head-on, and Britain, despite its maritime superiority, dared not attempt an invasion."
 guide_5: "To pressure Britain, Germany secretly supplied arms and military advisors to the IRA. On December 25, 1918, the so-called Christmas Uprising—the Irish War of Independence—broke out. Simultaneously, Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare to starve Britain into submission. Between January 17, 1919, and February 4, 1920, German U-boats sank 1,201,600 tons of shipping, imposing a heavy burden on Britain.\n\nSeeing further war as pointless, the British government proposed an armistice to Germany on February 19, 1920. Portugal, similarly constrained by German incursions into its waters and Britain’s capitulation, signed an armistice with Germany that same afternoon. Serbia, last holding out hope in Britain, surrendered to the Central Powers on February 22, 1920, when Britain capitulated. All European nations then ceased hostilities. Observing this, Japan concluded its own armistice with Germany and the Central Powers on May 5, 1920. Thus ended the Great War—with thirty million dead. On August 8, 1920, the Treaty of Leipzig was signed between the Central Powers and Portugal. On August 20, the Budapest Treaty was concluded, leading to Montenegro’s annexation by Austria-Hungary and making Serbia and Albania protectorates of Austria-Hungary. Finally, on November 11, 1920, the Copenhagen Treaty was signed between Britain and the Central Powers, and Japan—having no separate peace—simply withdrew from occupied territories, bringing the war to a definitive close."
